        ],
        explanation: "Hemolytic-uremic syndrome/Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are the prototypes for MAHA. HUS is loosely defined by the presence of MAHA and renal Impairment. It is characterized by the triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (indicated by hematuria and decreased urine output). It often follows an episode of bloody diarrhea caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (e.g., E. coli 0157:H7). The history of bloody diarrhea, along with the laboratory findings, strongly suggests HUS. The initial management of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is supportive, RBC transfusions for anemia (Hgb 6-7g/dL or Hct <18%), Platelet transfusion for patients who have significant clinical bleeding or if an invasive procedure is required, Stopping nephrotoxic drugs or those that are implicated in the etiology of HUS and Dialysis in patients with symptomatic uremia. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a small vessel vasculitis that typically presents with a purpuric rash on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, arthralgia, and renal involvement. It does not usually cause significant thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura typically presents with isolated thrombocytopenia and petechiae without anemia or renal involvement. Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis usually follows a streptococcal throat or skin infection and presents with hematuria, hypertension, and edema. While APSGN can cause hematuria and renal impairment, it does not typically present with thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia, making this diagnosis less likely.- Nelson 21st p4872-4877, Harrison's 21st p8677, p10247, UpToDate"

        ],
        explanation: "The radial nerve is the most likely to be injured with fractures of the lower and upper thirds of the forearm. This nerve runs along the posterior aspect of the humerus nd then crosses over to the lateral side of the forearm, providing motor function to the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers and sensory function to the dorsal aspect of the hand. The described symptoms of difficulty in wrist and finger extension (wrist drop) and sensory loss over the dorsal aspect of the hand are characteristic of radial nerve injury. Lateral cutaneous nerve (of forearm) is a continuation of musculocutaneous nerve and its injury affects sensation over the lateral forearm. The ulnar nerve typically affects the medial aspect of the hand and provides motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, leading to symptoms such as claw hand and sensory loss over the fifth finger and medial half of the fourth finger. It is less commonly injured in forearm fractures compared to the radial nerve. The median nerve provides motor innervation to the flexor muscles of the forearm and some intrinsic muscles of the hand. Injury to this nerve would result in symptoms such as difficulty with thumb opposition and sensory loss over the palmar aspect of the first three and a half fingers. The symptoms described in the case are not consistent with median nerve injury. - Apley 10th p295, Tintinalli's 9th p1833, p1813, p1818"

        explanation: "The ulnar nerve innervates the little finger and the medial half of the ring finger, both for sensation and motor functions. It is also responsible for the abduction and adduction of the fingers through the interossei muscles. A cut on the ulnar side of the wrist causing decreased sensation in these areas and difficulty with finger abduction and adduction strongly suggests ulnar nerve damage. The radial nerve is primarily responsible for the extension of the wrist and fingers and sensation over the dorsum of the hand, particularly the thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Injury to the radial nerve typically results in wrist drop and loss of sensation in these areas. The median nerve is responsible for the sensation of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the lateral half of the ring finger. It also controls the muscles involved in thumb opposition and flexion of the lateral fingers.The musculocutaneous nerve primarily innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm (biceps, brachialis) and provides sensation to the lateral forearm.

        ],
        explanation: "Bladder rupture is a significant concern in high-speed motor vehicle accidents, particularly when there is a seatbelt sign across the lower abdomen. The seatbelt can cause a direct compression injury to the bladder, especially if it is full at the time of impact. Intra-peritoneal bladder rupture is commonly associated with BAT especially seatbelt injury and extra-peritoneal bladder rupture whichc is more common often occur in the setting of pelvic injury The presence of free fluid in the peritoneal cavity is consistent with urine leakage due to bladder rupture. The liver is a common site of injury in blunt abdominal trauma, especially in high-speed accidents. However, liver lacerations typically present with significant right upper quadrant pain and can lead to hemoperitoneum, not necessarily free fluid alone. The seatbelt sign across the lower abdomen and presence of free fluid without specific right upper quadrant pain makes this less likely.Splenic injuries are also common in blunt abdominal trauma and typically present with left upper quadrant pain and signs of hemorrhagic shock if severe. Free fluid from splenic rupture would usually be blood, and the clinical presentation often includes left shoulder pain (Kehr's sign). The seatbelt sign and distribution of the pain make this less likely without further specifics on location of the pain. - UpToDate, Schwartz's 11th p231"

        ],
        explanation: "SGLT-2 inhibitors (such as empagliflozin or dapagliflozin) are beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure. These medications not only help in lowering blood glucose levels but have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death. They promote glycosuria, which can lead to weight loss and BP reduction, both of which are beneficial in heart failure management. Sulfonylureas (such as glipizide or glyburide) increase insulin secretion from the pancreas. While they are effective in lowering blood glucose levels, they are associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. They do not offer the same cardiovascular benefits as SGLT-2 inhibitors and may potentially exacerbate heart failure due to weight gain. DPP-4 inhibitors are good options for elderly and CKD patients since the have reduced risk of hypoglycemia. But they don't have CV protecting effect. Insulin is effective for controlling blood glucose levels, especially in cases where oral medications are insufficient. However, it does not provide the additional cardiovascular benefits seen with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Insulin therapy can lead to weight gain and hypoglycemia, which may not be ideal for a patient with heart failure. It is typically reserved for cases where other medications are not achieving adequate glycemic control. - Harrison's 21st p7187, p11334"

            'Perform an emergency tracheostomy',
        ],
        explanation: "Tracheal foreign bodies account for 3-12% of airway foreign body cases. Children who have tracheal foreign bodies can present with dysphonia, dysphagia, dry cough, or biphasic stridor. Posteroanterior and lateral soft tissue neck radiographs (airway films) are abnormal in 92% of children, whereas chest radiographs are abnormal in only 58% of these cases. The treatment of choice for airway foreign bodies is prompt endoscopic removal with rigid instruments by a specialist (otolaryngologist or pulmonologist). Bronchoscopy is deferred only until providers have obtained preoperative studies and the patient has been prepared by adequate hydration and emptying of the stomach. Airway foreign bodies are usually removed the same day the diagnosis is first considered. Batteries stuck in the esophagus can cause rapid and severe damage, so they must be removed as soon as possible to prevent complications. Foreign bodies in the esophagus (except coins in the upper esophagus which may be removed using Magill forceps during direct laryngoscopy) are removed with rigid or flexible esophagoscopy Diligent follow-up is required after removal of foreign bodies, especially batteries, which can cause strictures, and sharp objects, which can injure the underlying esophagus. In the case of a retained battery, this case should be handled as a surgical emergency, as the negative pole of the battery directly damages the surrounding tissue, and tracheoesophageal fistula, aortic exsanguination, and mediastinitis have all been described after local tissue necrosis at the site where the battery has lodged. - Nelson 21st p3819, Schwartz's 11th p1717, UpToDate"

The patient also has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that was diagnosed 3 years ago. Echocardiography 2 months ago showed dynamic left ventricular outflow obstruction causing exertional symptoms, and the patient was started on metoprolol at that time. Temperature is 37.1 C, BP 122/78 mm mm Hg, PR 90/min, and RR 24/min. Lung auscultation reveals poor air movement and moderate wheezing. Chest x-ray shows only hyperinflation. She is diagnosed with an acute asthma exacerbation. Metoprolol is stopped and she is started on intravenous corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators. Once the patient's asthma exacerbation is stabilized, what is the best next step in management of her hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?",

            'Carvedilol',
            'Verapamil',
        ],
        explanation: "Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by an enlarged interventricular septum in combination with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. The LVOT obstruction worsens with low left ventricular (LV) blood volume; therefore, symptomatic management aims to maintain relatively high LV blood volume throughout the cardiac cycle. Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) and L-type calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil) are first-line agents for HCM complicated by LVOT obstruction as they increase LV blood volume to reduce LVOT tract obstruction in 2 ways: Negative chronotropy increases diastolic filling time to increase LV end-diastolic volume .Negative inotropy decreases contractility to cause blood ejection to complete at a higher LV end-systolic volume Although metoprolol is largely selective for beta 1 receptors, it can block beta 2 receptors as well, which likely contributed to this patient's acute asthma exacerbation. In patients who are intolerant of beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have similar beneficial effects and are a suitable alternative. Verapamil is generally preferred over diltiazem because diltiazem has some degree of systemic vasodilatory effects that are undesirable in HCM. Alcohol septal ablation involves the injection of ethanol into a septal perforator artery to cause infarction of the interventricular septum and help relieve LVOT obstruction.However, this procedure is not indicated until pharmacologic options have been exhausted. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) and other balanced vasodilators (eg, ACE inhibitors) are contraindicated in HCM because they reduce LV blood volume. Venous dilation reduces LV preload and arterial dilation reduces afterload, both of which reduce LV blood volume and can worsen LVOT obstruction and symptoms in HCM. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker and is more likely than metoprolol to exacerbate asthma symptoms via blockade of beta 2 receptors. In addition, carvedilol blocks alpha 1 receptors to cause balanced vasodilation, which can worsen symptoms in HCM.- Harrison's 21st p7271-7273, UpToDate"

            'Anterior hip Dislocation',
        ],
        explanation: "Posterior hip dislocation is often caused by high-energy trauma such as falls from heights or motor vehicle accidents. In an isolated posterior hip dislocation the leg is shortened and lies in an adducted, internally rotated and slightly flexed position. The severe pain, inability to bear weight, and physical examination findings in this patient are highly suggestive of a posterior hip dislocation. The dislocation must be reduced as soon as possible; rates of osteonecrosis and subsequent osteoarthritis are increased if the hip is dislocated for more than 6 hours. This requires sedation or general anaesthesia and is performed closed in the majority of cases. Closed reduction should not be attempted if there is an associated femoral neck fracture. Anterior hip dislocations, while less common than posterior, usually present with a leg that is externally rotated and abducted. The clinical presentation of a shortened, internally rotated leg in this patient does not fit with an anterior hip dislocation. Femoral shaft fracture typically results in significant pain, swelling, and deformity of the thigh. Often presents with gross deformity and angulation.Femoral neck fractures typically present with pain in the hip or groin and an inability to bear weight. The leg may appear shortened and externally rotated, not internally rotated as described in the scenario.

        explanation: "Popliteal artery injury can occur from fractures about the knee, especially femoral condyle fractures or displaced tibial plateau fractures, and from ligamentous injuries such as isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries, multiple ligamentous injuries, or knee dislocation. Popliteal artery circulation must be restored within 8 hours to avoid amputation, because collateral circulation is insufficient to maintain blood flow to the leg. A diminished pulse raises concern for vascular injury and should not be interpreted as vascular spasm. The popliteal artery runs behind the knee and is at risk of injury with knee dislocations or severe trauma to the knee. An absence of distal pulses and coolness of the foot strongly suggest injury to the popliteal artery, as it is the major vessel supplying blood to the lower. leg and foot. - Schwartz's 11th p232, Tintinalli's 9th p1851",

        ],
        explanation: "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volume of plasma filtered by the glomeruli per unit of time and typically begins to slowly decline at age 30-40. Starting at age 40-50, GFR loss becomes more rapid (ie, 8-10 mL/min/1.73 m2 per decade). This elderly patient's decrease in estimated GFR from 62 to 57 mL/min/1.73m2 over 4 years signifies a gradual and mild reduction in renal function. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio of 20 mg/g is within the normal range (<30 mg/g). This indicates no significant proteinuria, which rules out progressive or severe kidney damage. Age-related loss of renal function is considered normal and warrants no additional diagnostic studies or treatment. Oxidative stress and telomere shortening are thought to pla a role in age-related loss of renal function by promoting the following: Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) is beneficial in CKD due to its renoprotective effects, particularly in the presence of proteinuria. There is no indication to discontinue it, as it has likely contributed to preserving kidney function."

If the embolus breaks up or passes, flow is restored and vision returns quickly to normal without permanent damage. With prolonged interruption of blood flow, the inner retina suffers infarction. Ophthalmoscopy reveals zones of whitened, edematous retina following the distribution of branch retinal arterioles. The most common source is an atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery or aorta.

Patients who have a first-degree relative with sporadic (ie, not related to a hereditary colon cancer syndrome) colon cancer or advanced adenoma (eg, ≥10 mm, high-grade dysplasia), should be offered screening beginning at age 40 or 10 years before the age at which the relative's colon cancer was diagnosed, whichever comes first. This patient, whose father was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 53, should be offered colonoscopy at age 40. If the patient's initial colonoscopy is normal, repeat colonoscopy should be offered every 5 years (routine 10-year intervals can be considered for those who have only 1 first-degree relative with colon cancer if the diagnosis was made after age 60). - Schwartz 11th p1320."

            'Repeat chest X-ray to reassess the hemothorax',
        ],
        explanation: "An initial drainage of 1000 mL of blood followed by continued drainage exceeding 200 mL per hour indicates ongoing active bleeding. A massive hemothorax is defined in the adult as a volume of at least 1500mL.. Consider surgical exploration in the following circumstances: >1500mL of blood is evacuated immediately after tube thoracostomy, chest tube drainage of blood at 150 to 200 mL/h for 2-4hrs, or persistent blood transfusion is required to maintain hemodynamic stability. In patients with clear indications for operation, essential radiographs should be taken, and the patient should be transported to the OR immediately. Even though the drainage tube output is decreasing, our patient has class 3 hemorrhagic shock (decreased BP, PR above 120) and is in a category of 'non-responders' who have persistent hypotension despite aggressive resuscitation, which mandate immediate identification of the source of hypotension with appropriate intervention to prevent a fatal outcome. Clamping the chest tube in a patient with ongoing significant blood loss is not appropriate as it can worsen the situation by preventing further drainage and leading to retained hemothorax, tension hemothorax, or worsening respiratory distress. - Tintinalli's 9th p1732-1733, Schwartz's 11th p193, p215 & p220"

        ],
        explanation: "A corneal abrasion is a common injury resulting from mechanical trauma to the corneal surface, such as a finger poke. Symptoms include photophobia (sensitivity to light), tearing, foreign body sensation, and discomfort exacerbated by blinking. The redness of the eye and the acute onset of symptoms are consistent with a corneal abrasion. Work-up includes Slit-lamp examination, which uses fluorescein dye, measure the size (e.g., height and width) of the abrasion, and diagram its location. Evaluate for an AC reaction, infiltrate (underlying corneal opacifi cation), corneal laceration, and penetrating trauma. Conjunctival injury can cause redness and discomfort, it typically presents with less severe symptoms of photophobia and tearing compared to a corneal abrasion. In this scenario, the symptoms are more indicative of corneal involvement due to the direct trauma to the cornea. A foreign body in the eye can cause similar symptoms, but the history of a poke by the baby's finger makes corneal abrasion more likely than a retained foreign body. Foreign bodies often present with a sensation of irritation or grittiness but may not cause as much photophobia unless they are lodged in the cornea. Iritis is inflammation of the iris and can cause photophobia and pain, but it is less likely to be caused directly by trauma such as a finger poke. Additionally, iritis typically presents with other signs such as a small, irregular pupil and pain that worsens with eye movement, which are not described in this case. - The Wills Eye Manual 6th p16, UpToDate."

        ],
        explanation: "Corneal abrasion involves a breach of the epithelium, and stains well with fluorescein. If located over the pupillary area, vision may be grossly impaired. The mainstay of treatment for a corneal abrasion is the use of topical antibiotics to prevent infection. Lubricating eye drops or ointments can also be used to promote comfort and healing. Steroids are generally avoided initially. Noncontact lens wearer: Antibiotic ointment (e.g., erythromycin, bacitracin, or bacitracin/polymyxin B q2-4h) or antibiotic drops (e.g., polymyxinB/trimethoprim or a fluoroquinolone). Abrasions secondary to fingernails or vegetable matter should be covered with a fluoroquinolone drop (e.g., ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin) or ointment (e.g., ciprofloxacin) at least. Contact lens wearer: Must have antipseudomonal coverage. May use antibiotic ointment or antibiotic drops at least. Steroids are generally not recommended initially for corneal abrasions because they can impair healing and increase the risk of infection. Combining them with antibiotics might be appropriate in some cases of inflammation or infection but not as a first-line treatment for a simple corneal abrasion. Oral antibiotics are not necessary for treating a simple corneal abrasion unless there is a risk of systemic infection, which is uncommon. - The Wills Eye Manual 6th p16-17, UpToDate."

        explanation: "This patient presents with infective endocarditis due to Enterococcus faecalis, a known pathogen in IV drug users. The bacterial cell wall is composed of cross-linked peptidoglycan subunits on a backbone of N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). Vancomycin inhibits transpeptidase from cross linking a growing peptidoglycan chain by binding to the D-alanine-D-alanine terminus of pentapeptide peptidoglycan subunits. Resistance to vancomycin stems primarily from replacement of the terminal D-alanine-D-alanine with D-alanine-D-lactate, which reduces vancomycin binding >1000-fold. Fosfomycin inhibits enolpyruvyl transferase, an enzyme involved in the first step of peptidoglycan synthesis. Ceftriaxone is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). It is unaffected by D-alanine/D-lactate substitutions Polymyxins act by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, not the cell wall, so their efficacy is unaffected by peptidoglycan precursor alterations. - UpToDate."

An elevated reticulocyte count indicates hemolysis as the cause of anemia; other findings associated with increased RBC destruction should be sought (e.g. elevated indirect bilirubin level, decreased haptoglobin, increased LDH, splenomegaly). A low reticulocyte count indicates a hypoproliferative state; renal disease, hypothyroidism and aplastic anemias may be present. Further evaluation of hemolytic anemias may include hemoglobin electrophoresis and Coombs' test.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine anemia screening at 12 months of age (4month if deemed to be high risk infant). At this point, infants may have exhausted their iron stores from birth and may not be receiving adequate dietary iron, making this an optimal time for screening and early intervention. This allows for early detection and treatment, helping to prevent the development of anemia and its associate complications. The AAP recommends screening for anemia: between ages of 9 to 12 months, for children with risk factors, test again at 15 to 18 month or when risk is identified, between ages of 15 to 18 months if the child is on iron fortified formula.- Nelson 21st p4411, UpToDate"

        ],
        explanation: "Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura is the most common cause of acute onset of thrombocytopenia in an otherwise well child. The exact antigenic target for most such antibodies in most cases of childhood acute ITP remains undetermined, although in chronic ITP many patients demonstrate antibodies against allb-ẞ3 and GPIb. After binding of the antibody to the platelet surface, circulating antibody-coated platelets are recognized by the Fc receptor on splenic macrophages, ingested, and destroyed. The classic presentation of ITP is a previously healthy 1-4 yr old child who has sudden onset of generalized petechiae and purpura. The parents often state that the child was fine yesterday and now is covered with bruises and purple dots. There may be bleeding from the gums and mucous membranes, particularly with profound thrombocytopenia (platelet <10k). As American Society of Hematology guidelines state, A single dose of IVIG (0.8-1.0 g/kg) or a short course of corticosteroids should be used as first-line treatment. IVIG for 1-2 days induces a rapid rise in platelet count (usually >20k) in 95% of patients within 48 hr, providing a temporary boost in platelet numbers while waiting for other treatments, such as corticosteroids, to take effect.Corticosteroid therapy has been used for many years to treat acute and chronic ITP in adults and children. Doses of prednisone at 1-4 mg/kg/24 hr appear to induce a more rapid rise in platelet count than in untreated patients with ITP. Corticosteroid therapy is usually continued for short course until a rise in platelet count to >20k has been achieved to avoid the long-term side effects of corticosteroid therapy, especially growth failure, diabetes mellitus, and osteoporosis. IVIG is often preferred for rapid elevation of platelet counts. Platelet transfusions are generally reserved for life-threatening bleeding in ITP because the transfused platelets are quickly destroyed by the immune system. The role of splenectomy in ITP should be reserved for 2 circumstances: (1) Age ≥4yr with severe ITP that has lasted >1yr (chronic ITP) and whose symptoms are not easily controlled with therapy and (2) when life-threatening hemorrhage (ICH) complicates acute ITP, if the platelet count cannot be corrected rapidly with transfusion of platelets and administration of IVIG and corticosteroids. - Nelson 21st p4608-4610, UpToDate"

In clinically suspected bacterial meningitis, after addressing airway, breathing, and circulation status, immediately initiate empiric antibiotic therapy. Never delay administration of empiric antibiotic therapy for neuroimaging or to perform LP, because antibiotic treatment takes precedence over definitive diagnosis. Obtain blood cultures to assist in identification of the organism and to help guide inpatient therapy if it will not delay time to antibiotics. If LP is delayed or contraindicated (e.g., significant bleeding tendencies): take blood culture (2 bottles, if available) and start antibiotics without delay. Unless contraindications exist (raised intracranial pressure, uncorrected shock, disordered coagulation, thrombocytopenia, respiratory insufficiency, local infection, ongoing convulsions), lumbar puncture should be undertaken to identify and confirm the etiology of suspected meningococcal meningitis, whose presentation cannot be distinguished from that of meningitis of other bacterial causes. Some authorities have recommended a CT brain scan prior to lumbar puncture because of the risk of cerebral herniation in patients with raised intracranial pressure. However, a normal CT scan is not uncommon in the presence of raised intracranial pressure in meningococcal meningitis, and the decision to perform a lumbar puncture should be made on clinical grounds.

        explanation: "Tension pneumothorax and simple pneumothorax have similar signs, symptoms, and examination findings, ings, but hypotension qualifies the pneumothorax as a tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax is presumed in any patient manifesting respiratory distress and hypotension in combination with any of the following physical signs: tracheal deviation away from the affected side, lack of or decreased breath sounds on the affected side, and subcutaneous emphysema on the affected side. In this patient his vitals are relatively stable making the diagnosis more towards simple pneumothorax. Chest tube insertion is the appropriate next step to re-expand the lung and relieve the pneumothorax. This intervention will help to stabilize the patient by improving ventilation and oxygenation. Thoracotomy is an invasive surgical procedure that is typically reserved for cases where there is massive hemothorax, persistent significant bleeding, or other indications of major internal injury that cannot be managed by less invasive means. In this scenario, the initial management should aim at stabilizing the patient's respiratory status. Endotracheal intubation might be necessary if the patient were in severe respiratory distress or failure, it does not address the underlying issue of pneumothorax. It might be considered if the patient's respiratory status worsens, but it is not the primary next step in this scenario. Needle decompression is typically used as an emergency procedure to relieve tension pneumothorax when immediate action is needed to stabilize the patient. Given that the patient is stable enough for a more definitive procedure, chest tube insertion is preferred over needle decompression. - Schwartz's 11th p212-213, Tintinalli's 9th p1735"

        question : "A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to knee pain and swelling after a motor vehicle collision. He was unrestrained in the passenger seat, and his shins struck the dashboard on impact. Vital signs are stable. The right knee is swollen and diffusely tender, and the patient guards the knee on examination. X-ray of the right knee shows a large effusion but no fracture or dislocation. Which of the following was most likely injured in this patient's knee joint?",
        options : [
            'Anterior cruciate ligament',

            'Medial collateral ligament',
            'Posterior cruciate ligament',
        ],
        explanation: "This patient most likely injured the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). There are four ligaments in the knee: the anterior cruciate ligament, the posterior cruciate ligament, and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments. These ligaments provide strength and stability to the knee. The PCL originates from the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle and inserts into the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia. Its function is to prevent posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. During the classic dashboard injury and Falling directly onto a flexed knee with the foot in plantar flexion, a strong posteriorly directed force strikes the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia while the knee is in a flexed position. This causes significant posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur and disrupts the PCL. PCL injury due to high-energy trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision) usually causes an acute, large hemarthrosis and diffuse tenderness of the knee. Integrity of the PCL may be tested using the posterior drawer test; however, the test can be difficult to perform if significant pain and swelling are present or if the patient guards the knee. Plain x-rays may show an effusion. Definitive diagnosis is made with MRI. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) functions to resist anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur. Therefore, a posteriorly directed force to the anterior tibia (eg, dashboard injury) is unlikely to cause an isolated ACL tear. Most (>70%) ACL injuries occur via noncontact mechanisms that cause the tibia to move anteriorly while under valgus stress (eg, sudden deceleration or pivot). The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) are classically injured when a force strikes the side of the knee. LCL injury typically occurs with a blow to the medial knee (varus stress injury); MCL injury typically occurs with a direct blow to the lateral knee while the foot is planted (valgus stress injury). Isolated tenderness along the lateral (LCL) or medial (MCL) aspect of the joint is commonly present. - Schwartz's 11th p1926, Tintinalli's 9th p1855"

        question : "A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department after an episode of choking in the restaurant. He was drinking and dining with his friends at a local restaurant, when he accidentally choked on a fish bone. He initially felt a sharp painful sensation, but this subsided to a vague discomfort after drinking four glasses of water. He denies having any difficulty in breathing, and only has a slight difficulty in swallowing his saliva. He has a mild discomfort and can still feel the fish bone lodged in the back of his throat. On a quick examination of his upper oropharynx, you do not see any evidence of fishbone. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
        options : [

            'Perform an urgent endoscopy to remove the fishbone',
        ],
        explanation: "The patient had an accidental ingestion of a fishbone. Depending on the severity of the obstruction, such patients can have a sudden onset of difficulty or inability to swallow oral secretions. They may also have a feeling or sensation of fullness, discomfort, or painful swallowing (odynophagia). Plain chest radiographs are useful in determining the exact location of the foreign body; however, certain objects, such as toothpicks or a fishbone, may not be easily visualized and can be missed on plain radiographs. Most of the patients with a history of foreign body ingestion are asymptomatic and have a negative radiograph. Such patients do not need any further treatment. In all other symptomatic patients or patients with a history of sharp object ingestion (e.g., fish or chicken bone, toothpicks, needles, or pins), an urgent endoscopy should be performed to remove the foreign body and to prevent esophageal perforation. Foreign bodies should not be allowed to remain in the esophagus for more than 24 hours. Sharp pointed objects (e.g., fishbone, pointed pins, etc.) have a high risk of esophageal perforation and should be removed urgently with endoscopy. Asking the patient to perform a finger sweep of his upper oropharynx is not appropriate. A blind finger sweep is not recommended. Giving the patient sucralfate or any other agent to move the foreign body further into the stomach is not recommended. Tintinalli's 9th p503, UpToDate"

        explanation: "Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and should be performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. In patients with prolonged intussusception and signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation, or pneumatosis intestinalis, hydrostatic reduction should not be attempted. Hydrostatic reduction with barium may be useful if pneumatic reduction is unsuccessful. The success rate of radiologic hydrostatic reduction under fluoroscopic or ultrasonic guidance is approximately 80-95% in patients with ileocolic intussusception. Hydrostatic (contrast or air) enema is the first-line definitive treatment for intussusception in a stable patient. This procedure is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as it can reduce the intussusception in most cases without the need for surgery. It is the preferred non-surgical treatment for this condition. Surgical intervention, such as laparotomy, is reserved for cases where hydrostatic reduction fails, if there is evidence of perforation, or if the patient is unstable. Given that the patient is currently stable and has a typical presentation of intussusception, hydrostatic reduction is the best initial definitive management. - Schwartz's 11th p1758, Nelson 21st p3336, UpToDate"

Her recent work-up revealed a 2.5-cm mass in the central portion of the left breast, 2 left axillary lymph nodes positive for carcinoma on fine needle aspiration, and no evidence of distant metastases. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, the left breast is swollen and has erythematous, thickened skin and an ill-defined mass that does not appear attached to the chest wall. Left axillary lymphadenopathy is present. The patient would like to know whether she is a candidate for breast-conserving therapy rather than mastectomy. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement regarding treatment for this patient?",

            'Mastectomy is needed due to the patients age and menopausal status',
        ],
        explanation: "This patient has inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), a rare but highly aggressive form of breast cancer. The hallmark features include: Erythematous, swollen breast with skin thickening (peau d'orange) and often no discrete mass. BCT consists of a lumpectomy plus adjuvant radiation therapy. BCT is cosmetically preferable to mastectomy and is associated with local recurrence rates and survival rates at least equivalent to mastectomy. However, there are absolute contraindications to BCT. These contraindications stem from either: failure of BCT to obtain adequate margin control, as in multifocal disease (eg, ≥2 primary tumors in separate quadrants), or failure of BCT to control an especially aggressive cancer, as in inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). This patient has IBC, a highly aggressive and angioinvasive breast cancer characterized by invasion of the dermal lymphatic system that results in classic skin changes (eg, erythema, skin thickening and dimpling [ie, peau d'orange]). Due to the aggressive nature and rapid spread of IBC through the lymphatic system, treatment typically necessitates neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy. Therefore, despite no evidence of distant metastases, BCT is absolutely contraindicated in this patient because she has IBC. - Schwartz's 11th p2036"

        question : "A 46-year-old woman comes to the office due to a breast mass she found while showering. The patient is unsure how long it has been present, but there is no pain, skin changes, or ripple discharge. She has regular menstrual cycles, and her er last menstrual period was I week ago. There is no family history of breast cancer. Physical examination reveals a 3-cm round, well-circumscribed mass in the left outer breast. The right breast has no abnormality, and there is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. The rest of the examination is normal. A diagnostic mammogram reveals a solid mass that is subsequently examined with core needle biopsy. Pathology is consistent with a fibroadenoma; however, it also returns with disordered cellular adherence, nuclear pleomorphisms, and areas of necrosis, findings consistent with nonclassic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",
        options : [
            'Aromatase inhibitor therapy',
            'Excisional biopsy',
            'Modified mastectomy with radiation therapy',
            'Routine mammogram surveillance',
        ],
        explanation: "Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) arises in the terminal ducts and lobules of the breast. It commonly presents as an incidental finding on breast biopsy performed for another reason (eg, fibroadenoma). LCIS is a histologic diagnosis, and most lesions have no mammographic or clinical correlates. LCIS classically has no pleomorphic changes, consistent with a noninvasive lesion; therefore, it is usually observed with surveillance (eg, reexamination and imaging). However, this patient's core needle biopsy is consistent with nonclassic LCIS due to nuclear pleomorphisms, disordered cellular adherence, and areas of necrosis, which are histologic findings suggestive of possible malignancy. Nonclassic LCIS is associated with an increased risk of having or developing invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma. Therefore, patients with nonclassic LCIS identified on core needle biopsy require excisional biopsy because there is a significant chance of identifying ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive cancer when the entire lesion is removed. After the lesion has been excised, the most common next step in management is surveillance (eg, reexamination and imaging). Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, may be offered. Aromatase inhibitor therapy (eg, anastrozole) is an alternate chemoprevention option for patients with nonclassic LCIS. However, an excisional biopsy is first needed to exclude an underlying invasive cancer. Early-stage breast cancer can be treated with modified mastectomy followed by radiotherapy. Excisional biopsy of this patient's nonclassic LCIS lesion may reveal invasive cancer, but therapy should not be initiated until the diagnosis is complete. Nonclassic LCIS alone is usually not an indication for mastectomy. Routine mammogram surveillance is indicated for this patient given her increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, an excisional biopsy is necessary to exclude DCIS and invasive cancer before beginning routine surveillance."

Macrolides and cephalosporins are alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides good coverage against Streptococcus pneumoniae and other typical bacterial pathogens. Azithromycin covers atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. This combination is recommended for the treatment of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who do not require ICU admission. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including some that cause CAP, and azithromycin covers atypical pathogens. However, this combination is not the first-line recommendation for hospitalized patients with CAP rather for outpatient treatment.

        explanation: "Chronic alcoholics are often deficient in thiamine (vitamin B1), and administration of high-dose thiamine is crucial to prevent or treat Wernicke's encephalopathy, a potentially life-threatening condition. Wernicke's disease is a medical emergency and requires immediate administration of high-dose thiamine, in a dose of 500 mg IV. The dose should be begun prior to treatment with IV glucose solutions and continued three times daily for 2-3 days. Thiamine may then be given in a dose of 250 mg IV or IM daily for 5 more days (in conjunction with other B vitamins), with oral thiamine then continued at 100 mg daily until the patient is no longer considered at risk. Glucose infusions may precipitate Wernicke's disease in a previously unaffected patient or cause a rapid worsening of an early form of the disease. For this reason, thiamine should be administered to all alcoholic patients requiring parenteral glucose. Haloperidol can be used to control severe agitation and hallucinations, but it does not address the underlying thiamine deficiency and can exacerbate the patient's condition if thiamine deficiency is present. - Harrison's 21st p8365 & p9224, UpToDate"

        ],
        explanation: "Diphyllobothrium latum, also known as the fish tapeworm, is the largest human tapeworm and is commonly found in regions where consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish is prevalent. It accumulates cobalamin from food, rendering the cobalamin unavailable for absorption. Individuals acquire the worm by eating raw or partly cooked fish. This parasite can cause vitamin B12 deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia, which presents as macrocytic anemia (elevated MCV). The patient's diet rich in freshwater fish supports this diagnosis. Ancylostoma duodenale is a type of hookworm that primarily causes iron deficiency anemia due to blood loss from the intestines. This would typically present with microcytic anemia (low MCV), not macrocytic anemia.Taenia solium, or the pork tapeworm, can cause taeniasis and cysticercosis but does not typically cause macrocytic anemia. It is more often associated with neurological symptoms when it causes cysticercosis. Ascaris lumbricoides is a roundworm that can cause nutritional deficiencies and intestinal obstruction, but it does not cause macrocytic anemia. Its primary effects are on the gastrointestinal tract and lungs during its life cycle. - Harrison's 21st p2962"

        ],
        explanation: "Atovaquone & proguanil (Malarone) is a preferred choice for malaria prophylaxis due to its effectiveness, relatively good side effect profile, and short duration of treatment after leaving the malaria-endemic area (only 7 days). It is suitable for both adults and children and covers areas with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, which is common in many endemic regions. Begin taking1-2 days before travel then daily at the same time while in endemic area and for 7 days after the travel. Primaquine is used primarily for the prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infections and for terminal prophylaxis. Mefloquine is another option. However, it has a higher risk of neuropsychiatric side effects, which may limit its use, especially in individuals with a history of mental health issues. It is also taken weekly, which can be less convenient compared to the daily regimen of atovaquone & proguanil. Doxycycline is effective for malaria prophylaxis in areas with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum. But atovaquone & proguanil is first line. - Harrison's 21st p6454, p6455 Table 224-8"

        ],
        explanation: "Approximately 20% of IHPS patients have intermittent emesis from birth that then progresses to the classic picture. After vomiting, the infant is hungry and wants to feed again. As vomiting continues, a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ion, and chloride leads to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. The diagnosis has traditionally been established by palpating the pyloric mass. The mass is firm, movable, approximately 2 cm in length, olive shaped, hard, best palpated from the left side, and located above and to the right of the umbilicus in the mid epigastrium beneath the liver's edge. The olive is easiest palpated after an episode of vomiting. This condition commonly occurs in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (iHPS) due to repeated vomiting, which leads to loss of stomach acid (hydrochloric acid). The physical findings and laboratory results in this case support metabolic alkalosis as the most likely metabolic complication. - Nelson 21st p3293"

        explanation: "Acute Severe Hypertension also known as accelerated hypertension or hypertensive crisis, acute severe hypertension is characterized by extremely high blood pressure with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and in severe cases, retinopathy, encephalopathy, cardiac failure, renal injury, and seizures. It includes hypertensive urgency and emergency. For life-threatening symptoms, ICU admission and IV drug infusion (e.g., labetalol, nicardipine, sodium nitroprusside) are necessary for carefully monitored BP reduction. Continuous BP monitoring via arterial lines is recommended. BP should be lowered gradually, with a reduction of no more than 25% over the first 8 hours and normalization over 24-48 hours to avoid compromising organ perfusion. IV labetalol is suitable for rapid BP control in hypertensive emergencies to prevent complications. For children with asymptomatic mild hypertension without organ damage, lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and regular exercise, are the mainstay of therapy. Pharmacologic treatment is indicated for symptomatic hypertension, stage 2 hypertension without modifiable risk factors, comorbidities like diabetes or CKD, or persistent hypertension despite lifestyle changes. Captopril is an ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension and proteinuria, particularly in chronic management. However, in a case of hypertensive emergency with significantly elevated BP (190/110 mmHg), immediate control is necessary, and captopril, an oral medication, does not act quickly enough for such an acute situation. - Nelson 21st p4351-4352, UpToDate"

The parents are concerned about her risk of having hemophilia A. The birth father and his brother (the paternal uncle) have hemophilia A.

            'The girl has hemophilia',
            'The girl will be a carrier',
        ],
        explanation: "Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder that occurs almost exclusively in males. Females are usually asymptomatic carriers of the disease, although mild bleeding is possible in carriers. A female may acquire hemophilia in the rare situation in which her father has hemophilia and her mother is a carrier who transmits the abnormal allele to her. This patient's birth mother has no family history of bleeding, including in male relatives; therefore, it is highly unlikely that the birth mother is a carrier. A father who has hemophilia will transmit the abnormal allele to all his daughters and, consequently, they will be carriers of the disease. Sons will be unaffected, as they receive only a single, normal allele on the X chromosome inherited from their mother. If the mother is a carrier, her daughters have a 50% chance of being carriers, and her sons have a 50% chance of having hemophilia.",

The process of consent for a procedure relies upon written and informed consent which the patient has to understand. When a patient has impaired mental capacity, the doctor may be uncertain whether the patient is competent to give informed consent. Under English law no other person can consent to treatment on behalf of an adult, though it is desirable that next of kin are consulted before treating an adult without consent.

        ],
        explanation: "The combination of ascending flaccid paralysis, sensory disturbances (tingling), and areflexia is characteristic of a condition affecting the spinal cord. This presentation is consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves, often starting with the lower extremities and progressing upward. While GBS primarily affects the peripheral nerves (spinal nerve roots), the condition's most significant impact can be considered on the spinal cord level where these nerves originate. Although GBS is primarily a peripheral nerve disorder, the initial presentation can often suggest a spinal cord lesion due to the extensive involvement of nerve roots and the ascending pattern of paralysis. Lesions in the anterior horn (such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) primarily affect motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy, but they typically do not cause sensory disturbances such as tingling. Additionally, these lesions are not usually characterized by a sudden onset of flaccid paralysis. Disorders of the NMJ, such as myasthenia gravis, cause muscle weakness that can fluctuate and worsen with activity. However, they do not typically present with sensory disturbances (tingling) or reflex abnormalities like areflexia. Lesions affecting the spinal nerves can cause motor and sensory deficits, including weakness and tingling, in the distribution of the affected nerves. However, these lesions usually produce segmental or radicular symptoms rather than the generalized pattern described in this patient. - UpToDate, Harrison's 21st p12718"

        ],
        explanation: "Given the patient's symptoms and the physical findings of a friable, easily bleeding vaginal mass, there is a high suspicion for malignancy, such as vaginal or cervical cancer. A punch biopsy is the most direct and immediate method to obtain tissue for histopathological examination. This will help confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact nature of the mass, which is crucial for guiding further management and treatment. Ultrasound can be helpful in assessing the pelvic organs and providing information about the extent of the disease, it is not the primary diagnostic tool for a friable vaginal mass. The ultrasound may be useful later to evaluate the extent of the disease once the diagnosis is confirmed. A Pap smear is a screening test for cervical cancer and pre-cancerous changes in the cervical cells. While it can detect abnormal cells, it is not the best next step for evaluating a visible vaginal mass. The Pap smear may miss a high-grade lesion or cancer if the lesion is not within the transformation zone of the cervix. - Current ObGyn 11th p1465, William's Gynecology 3rd p672"

        ],
        explanation: "This patient with advanced HIV has Indolent pulmonary symptoms, significant hypoxia, and chest x-ray evidence of interstitial infiltrates, raising strong suspicion for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). P.jirovecii is an atypical fungus that causes opportunistic pulmonary infections in those with significant immunocompromise. Patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm are at greatest risk and usually present with indolent fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. Profound hypoxia and tachypnea are common, and chest x-ray usually reveals bilateral interstitial or alveolar infiltrates. Patients with high pretest probability for PCP often receive empiric treatment, but definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of organisms in respiratory secretions. Induced sputum is the least invasive way to obtain respiratory samples; however, diagnostic sensitivity is 50%-90%. As such, negative results necessitate further testing if PCP is suspected. Candida typically causes mucocutaneous infections (eg, oral thrush) in those with HIV; invasive infections are more common in patients with central venous catheter, significant neutropenia, or hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Pulmonary Candida infections usually cause airspace consolidation or cavitary lesions (not interstitial infiltrates). Pulmonary tuberculosis reactivation is common in those with advanced HIV and may manifest with fever, weight loss, malaise, shortness of breath, and cough. However, chest x-ray typically reveals cavitary infiltrates in the upper lobes and/or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and military lobar opacities. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia typically causes severe, rapidly progressive, necrotizing pneumonia with high fever, septic shock, and multilobar cavitary infiltrates. This patient with indolent symptoms and interstitial infiltrate is unlikely to have S.aureus pneumonia. - UpToDate"

Manual rotation is a technique used to rotate the fetal head to a more favorable position, such as occiput anterior, which can facilitate descent and delivery. Either standard forceps or specialized forceps, such as Kielland forceps, are used. With the latter, each handle has a small knob, and branches are placed so that this knob faces the occiput.

Impaired relatedness - unstable relationships with others, identity disturbance, and chronic emptiness. b. Affective dysregulation - affective lability, excessive anger, and efforts to avoid abandonment c. Behavior dysregulation - impulsivity, suicidality, and self-injurious behavior Acute stress disorder (ASD) is characterized by acute stress reactions that may occur in the initial month after a person is exposed to a traumatic event (threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violation). The disorder includes symptoms of intrusion, dissociation, negative mood, avoidance, and arousal. Although mood disorders may co-occur, this patient does not have distinct mood episodes of sufficient duration to diagnose unipolar or bipolar depression. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major depressive episodes (requiring a duration >2 weeks) and hypomanic episodes (requiring a duration >4 days). Major depressive disorder involves major depressive episodes with no history of (hypo)mania. This patient's rapid and brief mood shifts (lasting from hours to days) in response to interpersonal triggers are better explained as the mood reactivity associated with BPD. Fears of abandonment are also characteristic of dependent personality disorder, but these individuals lack the impulsivity, uncontrolled anger, and history of unstable, intense relationships seen in BPD. Feelings of rejection typically lead to increasing submissiveness rather than rage and impulsive suicidal behavior."

            'Obtain surgical consultation',
        ],
        explanation: "This patient's presentation suggests complete rectal prolapse with strangulation and gangrene. Rectal prolapse is due to a mucosal or full-thickness layer of rectal tissue sliding through the anal orifice. Risk factors for rectal prolapse include prior pelvic surgery, pelvic floor dysfunction or anatomical defects, conditions causing increased intra-abdominal pressure (eg, chronic straining with constipation, benign prostatic hypertrophy), or women >age 40 with prior vaginal deliveries. Patients usually develop difficulty with defecation, diarrhea/fecal incontinence, discomfort (not significant pain) in the anal area, rectal bleeding, and a protruding rectal mass. Symptoms may occur intermittently. Significant rectal pain suggests a different underlying disorder. Diagnosis is made clinically by physical examination showing a mass extending through the anus with concentric rings of rectal mucosa. Management depends on the extent of prolapse and symptoms: Medical management is usually sufficient for patients without a full thickness rectal prolapse. Uncomplicated prolapsed rectal mucosa can be reduced by gentle digital pressure. Additional therapies include adequate fluid and fiber intake, pelvic floor exercises, and possible biofeedback for fecal incontinence. Surgery (intra-abdominal or perineal approach) is preferred for patients who have complete rectal prolapse (such as this patient) or prolapse with fecal incontinence and/or constipation. Untreated complete rectal prolapse can lead to strangulation and gangrene of the rectal mucosa. This patient needs prompt treatment and possible emergency surgical intervention in the form of a rectosigmoidectomy. Outpatient medical management is not recommended at this point."

Inadvertent damage to the right hepatic artery is most difficult to control laparoscopically. The cystic artery is the primary artery supplying the gallbladder. It is commonly ligated during a cholecystectomy. While bleeding from the cystic artery stump can occur, it typically presents earlier in the post-operative period, and not several days later as described. - Bailey 25th p1112, Schwartz's 11th p1423"

         explanation: "Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for atlantoaxial instability, which can lead to cervical spine injury, particularly during contact sports. Screening with a cervical spine X-ray can help detect any instability or anomalies that could pose a significant risk of spinal cord injury. This makes it the most critical screening test to ensure safety before allowing participation in contact sports. Contact sports are types of sports in which players physically interact with one another, often involving direct physical contact as an essential part of the game. This contact can include tackling, blocking, checking, or other forms of physical engagement. Echocardiogram is essential in evaluating congenital heart defects, which are common in children with Down syndrome, it is not the most immediate concern for contact sports. Many congenital heart issues would have been detected earlier in life, and an echocardiogram is not specifically necessary before engaging in contact sports unless there are specific cardiac symptoms or concerns. - Nelson 21st p1038, UpToDate"

        ],
         explanation: "A holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is classic for a ventricular septal defect. The murmur results from the blood flow from the left ventricle to the right ventricle during systole. The prominent precordial heave is due to the increased right ventricular workload. Over time, this can lead to hypertrophy of the heart as seen on echocardiogram. There is no pulse delay in VSD. Coarctation of the aorta typically presents with upper limb hypertension, lower limb hypotension, and diminished or delayed femoral pulses compared to the radial pulses (radio-femoral pulse delay). The murmur in coarctation of the aorta is usually a systolic murmur best heard over the back or left infraclavicular area, not a holosystolic murmur at the LLSB. Aortic stenosis typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. It may also cause a heave, but it does not typically cause a holosystolic murmur at the LLSB or a precordial heave as prominently as VSD does.- Nelson 21st p4151-4152, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC) occurs in most pregnancies and begins when the gravid uterus reaches the level of the umbilicus (ie, 20 weeks gestation). The degree of obstruction is most prominent during the third trimester and is worse when the mother lies in the supine or right lateral decubitus position. IVC compression reduces venous return (ie, cardiac preload), which subsequently decreases cardiac output. Most patients compensate for this physiologic change with increased collateral blood flow primarily through the azygous vein (connecting the iliac veins to the superior vena cava), which completely bypasses the IVC and maintains venous return. Because of significant anatomic variation of the azygous vein, some lack this robust collateral circulation. These patients are particularly sensitive to the decrease in venous return occurring in the supine or right lateral decubitus position, a condition known as supine hypotension syndrome (or aortocaval compression syndrome)."

         explanation: "Meconium-stained fluid is present in 10-20% of deliveries. It is extremely rare if delivery takes place prior to 34 weeks' gestation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid is not considered a normal occurrence and should be taken seriously. While it can happen in healthy pregnancies, it often requires closer monitoring and intervention to prevent complications. Passage of meconium in utero usually indicates fetal distress, and those personnel present at the delivery should be alerted by the presence of meconium to the possibility that the newborn may be depressed at birth. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) is often an indicator of fetal distress or hypoxia. Fetal hypoxia can lead to increased intestinal peristalsis and relaxation of the anal sphincter, resulting in the passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid. This can pose risks such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) if the meconium is inhaled by the fetus. The majority (94-97%) of infants born through meconium-stained fluid will not develop meconium aspiration syndrome, but when it does occur, infants are often critically ill. Besides, late deceleration (smooth falls in the FHR beginning after the contraction has started and ending after the contraction has ended) are associated with fetal hypoxemia and a potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality. - Current ObGyn 11th p232, p701-702, William's Obstetrics 26th p1522"

Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated, with no episodes of bleeding prior to delivery. The patient's labor was complicated by a significant intrapartum abruptio placentae, although she ultimately had a vaginal delivery. She received the same standard dose of anti-D immune globulin at 28 weeks gestation and immediately postpartum. She did not require a blood transfusion and recovered with iron supplementation. Prior to this visit, the patient came to the emergency department due to cramping without bleeding, and a transvaginal ultrasound at that time was consistent with & weeks gestation. Today, she has no vaginal bleeding, leakage of fluid, or contractions; fetal movements are occasional. She has no chronic medical problems and no surgical history. Temperature is 36.7C, BP 100/70 mm Hg, and PR 80/min. Fundal height is 30cm. FHR is 145/min. Routine blood work shows that anti-D antibody titers are 1:32.

            'No prophylaxis between pregnancies',
        ],
         explanation: "An inadequate dose of anti-D immune globulin postpartum is the most most likely likely cause of anti-D allolmmunization (eg, positive antibody screen) in this patient. Typically, a standard 300 µg anti-D Immune globulin dose is administered at 28 weeks gestation and again <72 hours postpartum in an Rh(D)-negative mother with a Rh(D)-positive infant. However, pregnancies complicated by massive fetomaternal hemorrhage (eg, abruptio placentae) may require adjustments in the anti-D Immune globulin dose, as the standard dose of anti-D immune globulin prevents maternal sensitization only up to 30 mL of fetal blood. In cases of fetomaternal hemorrhage, the amount of fetomatemal transfusion is calculated, so that an adequate dose of anti-D immune globulin can be administered within the 72-hour timeframe. The rosette test is a qualitative screening that determines the presence of fetomaternal hemorrhage. If negative, the standard dose of anti-D immune globulin is administered. If positive, the amount of hemorrhage can be determined using a Kleihauer-Betke test or flow cytometry, and the dose of anti-D immune globulin is increased based on the percentage of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation. A standard dose of anti-D immune globulin is administered at 28 weeks gestation in uncomplicated pregnancies to neutralize occult fetomaternal hemorrhage. This patient's first pregnancy was uncomplicated at 28 weeks gestation and did not require an adjusted anti-D immune globulin dose. Early prophylaxis with anti-D immune globulin is indicated in patients with vaginal bleeding or trauma prior to 28 weeks gestation, conditions not seen in this patient. Prophylaxis between pregnancies is rarely indicated (eg, after accidental transfusion of Rh-positive blood). - William's Obstetrics 26th p891-893"

         explanation: "A firm, palpable breast mass with Ill-defined borders is concerning for malignancy. Additional clinical features suggestive of malignancy include an Immobile mass with associated lymphadenopathy, expressed nipple discharge, skin changes, or new-onset nipple inversion. However, medical history and physical examination are not sufficient for diagnosing or excluding malignancy in patients with breast masses, so diagnosis requires further evaluation with imaging. In patients age ≥40, first-line imaging is with mammography due to its ability to further characterize the mass and determine the need for biopsy. Mammography uses low-dose radiation on breast tissue compressed between 2 plates. On mammography, cancer typically appears as a spiculated soft tissue mass with calcifications. Additional mammographic findings concerning for malignancy include architectural distortion and linear branching calcifications. If mammography shows the lesion, but it has no features suggestive of malignancy, an ultrasound can be performed to further characterize it (eg, solid, cystic). If imaging indicates possible malignancy, a core needle biopsy is performed to obtain tissue for histologic diagnosis, which will guide further management if malignancy is identified. Ultrasound (which uses soundwaves rather than low-dose radiation) alone is used to evaluate breast masses in women age <30 because the increased breast density in these patients reduces the sensitivity of mammography (eg, due to limited radiation penetration). A breast MRI is associated with a high false-positive rate and unnecessary biopsies; therefore, it is not used as initial imaging in the evaluation of palpable breast masses. Instead, an MRI is indicated to evaluate cancer metastasis. It can be also used for breast cancer screening in high-risk patients (eg, BRCA mutation, chest irradiation). - Schwartz's 11th p584, Bailey 25th p828"

            'Perform angiography',

         explanation: "Along with assessing hemodynamic stability, the first step in evaluating a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is determining whether the source is in the upper or lower Gl tract, with the ligament of Treitz separating the 2 sites. Bright red blood from the rectum (BRBPR) is nearly always due to a lower GI bleed (LGIB). Hematemesis and melena are more common in upper GI bleed (UGIB), although an UGIB can sometimes present with BRBPR if bleeding is particularly brisk. Hemodynamic compromise, orthostasis, and a blood urea nitrogen to creatinine (BUN/Cr) ratio >20:1 are suggestive of UGIB. A nasogastric lavage with aspiration of bile and absence of blood increases the likelihood of LGIB if the bleeding source is unclear, however, it can miss a distal UGIB. This patient with BRBPR is hemodynamically stable and has a normal BUN/Cr ratio as well as bilious fluid on nasogastric aspirate, consistent with LGIB. She received appropriate initial management (fluids, blood type and cross-match). Colonoscopy has diagnostic and potentially therapeutic abilities in LGIB and would be the next best step in management. If no bleeding source is found, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is performed. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable or in whom UGIB is suspected, EGD should be considered first to exclude a brisk UGIB. Diverticulosis is a common cause of brisk, painless hematochezia in an elderly patient and can readily be diagnosed by colonoscopy. Unlike diverticulosis, diverticulitis (which typically presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and low-grade fever, not BRBPR) would be a a contraindication to colonoscopy due to the risk of perforation. A non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen can be helpful to evaluate for bleeding into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum, but is not routinely used for evaluation of a Gl hemorrhage. An arterial-phase contrast-enhanced CT with negative oral contrast can help to localize the source of bleeding, but this method is rarely utilized.Angiography can be considered in patients with BRBPR in whom EGD did not reveal a bleeding source and who continue to have persistent bleeding but are too hemodynamically unstable for a colonoscopy. If angiography is unsuccessful, other techniques (eg, colonoscopy if the patient is stable, tagged red blood cell scan, enteroscopy, surgery) are considered. - UpToDate",

        ],
         explanation: "This patient with irregular menses and enlarged ovaries likely has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of infertility due to anovulation. Ovulation induction agents (eg, letrozole, clomiphene) can be used to treat anovulatory infertility by increasing gonadotropin levels (ie, FSH, LH), which stimulates ovulation.  Letrozole and clomiphene stimulate gonadotropin release via manipulation of different targets on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis: Letrozole acts on the ovary. Patients with PCOS typically have increased ovarian estrogen (eg, estradiol) production, which inhibits FSH, LH, and ovulation. Ovarian estrogen production occurs primarily by the conversion of androgens (produced by theca cells) into estrogens within granulosa cells that contain the enzyme aromatase. Letrozole inhibits aromatase (ie, prevents androgen-to-estrogen conversion) and suppresses ovarian estradiol production. Letrozole also inhibits aromatase in adipose tissue, decreasing another source of estrogen (eg, estrone). In response, the pituitary releases more FSH and LH, which stimulates ovulation. Clomiphene acts on estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary. When estrogen levels are high (as in PCOS), there is negative estrogenic feedback on both the hypothalamus and pituitary to stop the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH. Clomiphene binds to estrogen receptors for an extended period, resulting in receptor depletion in the hypothalamus and pituitary, thereby allowing for continued FSH and LH release. Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, decreases prolactin secretion. Prolactin normally inhibits FSH release, so patients with hyperprolactinemia (eg, lactotroph adenoma). often have infertility. In these patients, bromocriptine can normalize prolactin levels and restore FSH and estrogen levels. Increased endometrial proliferation, which increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, occurs with the use of unopposed estrogen (eg, estrogen-only hormone therapy) or certain selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen)."

         explanation: "Two imaging studies are commonly used to establish the diagnosis. Ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis in the majority of cases. Criteria for diagnosis include pyloric thickness 3-4 mm, an overall pyloric length 15-19 mm, and pyloric diameter of 10-14 mm. Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of approximately 95%. When contrast studies are performed, they demonstrate an elongated pyloric channel (string sign), a bulge of the pyloric muscle into the antrum (shoulder sign), and parallel streaks of barium seen in the narrowed channel, producing a 'double tract sign'. Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred initial diagnostic modality for IHPS. It allows direct visualization of the hypertrophied pylorus muscle, which appears as a thickened muscular 'olive' at the pyloric canal. Ultrasound has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing IHPS and is non-invasive, making it suitable for use in infants. Upper GI series is preferred to U/S if the neonate came with bilious vomiting, in which we use it to localize the site of intestinal obstruction (e.g. to differentiate malrotation with mid-gut volvulus). EGD involves direct visualization of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum using a flexible endoscope. While it can be used to visualize the pyloric canal, it is invasive and typically not necessary for the initial diagnosis of IHPS. - Nelson 21st p3293 "

        ],
         explanation: "Rectal atresia is a rare defect occurring in only 1% of anorectal anomalies. It has the same characteristics in both sexes. The unique feature of this defect is that affected patients have a normal anal canal and a normal anus. The defect is often discovered while rectal temperature is being taken. An obstruction is present approximately 2 cm above the skin level. These patients need a protective colostomy. The functional prognosis is excellent because they have a normal sphincteric mechanism (and normal sensation), which resides in the anal canal. Lateral X-ray (invertogram) is the most appropriate initial investigation to determine the level of anal atresia. This imaging technique helps to visualize the distance between the distal rectal pouch and the perineum, thereby determining the level of the atresia. It is a standard diagnostic procedure in newborns with suspected anal atresia. -Nelson 21st p3493"

         explanation: "Esophageal atresia is a common cause of polyhydramnios. In esophageal atresia, the fetus cannot swallow amniotic fluid effectively, leading to an accumulation of fluid.

Ultrasound findings of esophageal atresia: Without TEF - Polyhydramnios, Nonvisualized or collapsed stomach, Dilated proximal esophageal pouch in the neck or mediastinum With TEF - difficult to diagnose prenatally because the fistula allows fluid to flow into the stomach.

         explanation: "The situation requires a collaborative and empathetic approach to resolve the conflict while ensuring the patient's care and well-being. The critically ill patient must receive timely care, and dismissing him could lead to fatal consequences. Negotiation allows you to explore alternative solutions to admit the patient, such as using temporary spaces or arranging a transfer. The nurse may have genuine concerns, such as overburdened staff or insufficient resources. A collaborative discussion helps address her concerns and encourages teamwork. By acknowledging her challenges, you build rapport and reduce resistance. A cooperative approach is more effective than confrontation. Accepting the nurse's response disregards the patient's critical condition and reflects passivity, which is inappropriate in a life-threatening situation. While determination is important, being forceful without understanding the other side's constraints may escalate the conflict and harm professional relationships. Escalating the issue without attempting resolution at the initial level may delay patient care and create an unnecessarily adversarial situation."

The presence of an aura, such as visual disturbances, is a common feature in some patients with migraines. A high index of suspicion is required to diagnose migraine: the migraine aura, consisting of visual disturbances with flashing lights or zigzag lines moving across the visual field or of other neurologic symptoms, is reported in only 20-25% of patients. This patient's symptoms are consistent with a migraine. Cluster headaches are severe, unilateral headaches that often occur around the eye or temple.

It actually is a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a number of distinctive genetic abnormalities that result in varying clinical behaviors and responses to therapy. ALL is characterized by the presence of lymphoblasts in the blood and bone marrow. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, pallor, easy bruising, and hepatosplenomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count with a high percentage of lymphoblasts, strongly suggest ALL. Iron-deficiency anemia can present with fatigue and pallor, it is less likely to cause the degree of anemia seen in this patient (Hb 5.8 g/dL) and is not typically associated with thrombocytopenia or hepatosplenomegaly. ITP primarily presents with isolated thrombocytopenia and does not typically cause anemia or the presence of lymphoblasts in the blood. Hepatosplenomegaly is also not a feature of ITP. Aplastic anemia can cause pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia), but it is not characterized by the presence of lymphoblasts in the blood.

         explanation: "Hyperviscosity syndrome is a pathologic condition in which blood is 'thicker' than normal and its flow is impaired. Blood viscosity depends on its plasma and cellular contents, and dehydration exacerbates hyperviscosity. Hyperproduction of any cell line can lead to hyperviscosity. Polycythemia (with a hematocrit >60%) and leukemia (with a WBC count >100,000/mm3 [>100 × 109/L] or a leukocrit >10%) are often are associated with clinically significant hyperviscosity. Initial symptoms are vague and may include fatigue, abdominal pain, headache, blurry vision, or, most commonly, altered mental status. Initial therapy is intravascular volume repletion, early involvement of a hematologist, and emergency plasmapheresis or leukapheresis. Leukapheresis quickly reduces the white blood cell count, alleviating the symptoms of leukostasis. High-dose corticosteroids are not the first-line treatment for leukostasis and are more commonly used in certain hematologic malignancies like lymphomas or in cases of tumor lysis syndrome. - Tintinalli's 9th p957, p1518, Harrison 21st p2239"

Accompanying hypomagnesemia, if present, should be treated with appropriate magnesium supplementation. Hypocalcemia is difficult to correct if hypomagnesemia is also present because of reduction of PTH and Ca2+ releases from bone. Therefore, magnesium should be replaced before, or in conjunction with, Ca2+ replacement. Increasing the dose may not be effective if there is concurrent hypomagnesemia. Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption, but if the hypocalcemia is refractory, checking and correcting magnesium first is essential.

The defect arises from failure of the normal process by which the tricuspid valve is separated from the RV myocardium. The anterior cusp of the valve retains some attachment to the valve ring, but the other leaflets are adherent to the wall of the right ventricle. The right ventricle is thus divided into 2 parts by the abnormal tricuspid valve: the first, a thinwalled 'atrialized' portion, is continuous with the cavity of the right atrium; the second, often smaller portion consists of normal ventricular myocardium. The right atrium is enlarged as a result of tricuspid valve regurgitation, although the degree is extremely variable. can present with a 'boat-shaped' or 'box-shaped' heart on X-ray due to an enlarged right atrium. Tetralogy of Fallot typically presents with a 'boot-shaped' heart on X-ray due to right ventricular hypertrophy. Transposition of the great arteries may show an 'egg-on-a-string' appearance on X-ray.

         explanation: "Primary Consideration: This is an emergency case where the patient is experiencing an active seizure, requiring immediate attention to stop the seizure to prevent hypoxia and further complications. The key steps in managing seizures involve securing the airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by terminating the seizure as soon as possible. Benzodiazepines, like intravenous lorazepam, are first-line treatment to quickly abort seizures. Lorazepam acts fast and has a longer duration in the central nervous system compared to other benzodiazepines, making it effective for initial seizure control. It also can be given IM or rectally if Iv access is difficult, which is the case in most actively seizing patients. Placing a spatula in the patient's mouth to prevent biting of the tongue is an outdated and potentially dangerous advice. Forcibly inserting objects into a seizing patient's mouth risks trauma to the teeth or airway and does not prevent complications. Intubation should be reserved for cases where the seizure does not resolve after initial treatment (status epilepticus) or where there is respiratory compromise. In this case, it is more appropriate to stop the seizure with medication first. - Tintinalli's 9th p1157, UpTodate."
