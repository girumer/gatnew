        question : "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease has dyspnea, orthopnea, and bilateral lower extremity edema. On examination, he has elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, and pitting edema in his lower extremities and his oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. His chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacological intervention for this patient?",
        options : [
            'Initiate treatment with ACE inhibitors',
            'Start intravenous furosemide',
            'Administer supplemental oxygen',
            'Prescribe beta-blockers',
        ],
         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of acute decompensated heart failure, which is a medical emergency. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that reduces the preload and afterload on the heart, and relieves the pulmonary and systemic congestion. The first principle of management in ADHF is to identify and address the factors that precipitated decompensation. Concurrent with the identification of HF precipitants, effective management of ADHF requires pharmacologic therapy directed at hemodynamic optimization, including relief of congestion (with loop diuretics), reduction in afterload, and maximization of vital organ perfusion. - While ACE inhibitors, supplemental oxygen, and beta-blockers are also used in the management of heart failure, they are not the first-line treatment in the acute setting where rapid symptom relief is needed. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are more commonly used for long-term management and after stabilization of the acute episode. Supplemental oxygen may be necessary if the patient's oxygen saturation drops further, but the immediate concem in this scenario is to address the fluid overload, which is best managed with a diuretic like furosemide. - Harrison's 21st p7170, UpToDate"

Her blood pressure at the clinic is 130/80 mmHg. She says that she has been monitoring her blood pressure at home and it is usually around 160/95 mmHg. She takes metformin and lisinopril regularly. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",

            'Resistant hypertension',
            'Malignant hypertension',
        ],
         explanation: "This condition occurs when a person has a normal blood pressure reading in the doctor's office but high blood pressure at home. It can be caused by factors such as stress, alcohol, caffeine, or smoking at home. Masked hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and end-organ damage. Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure measurements. White coat hypertension occurs when a patient experiences a spike in blood pressure specifically at the doctor's office, which is not the case here. Resistant hypertension would be considered if the patient's blood pressure remained high despite taking multiple blood pressure medications, and malignant hypertension is a severe form of high blood pressure that rapidly progresses, which does not align with the patient's stable condition and lack of complaints. - Harrison's 21st p6764, p7651"

        question : "A 32-week pregnant woman presents to the emergency department with dyspnea, orthopnea, and palpitations. She has a history of cardiac illness since childhood and did not receive any prenatal care. On examination, she has a loud pansystolic murmur at the apex, crackles in both lung bases, and pitting edema of the lower extremities. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and her pulse is 120 beats/min. An electrocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation.

            'Rheumatic heart disease',
            'Hypertensive emergency',
        ],
         explanation: "RHD is caused by chronic inflammation of the heart valves due to repeated episodes of streptococcal infection. It can lead to mitral stenosis, which is the most common cause of heart failure in pregnant women. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation on ECG supports the diagnosis of a chronic condition affecting the heart structure and function. The history of cardiac illness since childhood and the absence of prenatal care also point towards a pre-existing condition like rheumatic heart disease, rather than a pregnancy-related condition such as peripartum cardiomyopathy or a hypertensive emergency. Pulmonary embolism is less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the presence of a pansystolic murmur, which is not a feature of pulmonary embolism. Hallmark symptom of PE is dyspnea which is not explained by auscultatory findings (normal auscultation). - Harrison's 21st p7241, William's Obstetrics 26th p 2384"

        ],
         explanation: "This patient has sign of instability or cardiac rhythm disturbance, which are Hypotension, systemic hypoperfusion and extreme tachycardia (220-240). Synchronized cardioversion is main stay of management in unstable Afib which needs rapid Pericardioversion anticoagulation. The mainstay of stroke prevention is continuous anticoagulation therapy, most commonly using an oral medication. The options for anticoagulation are the oral factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban; the oral antithrombin inhibitordabigatran; and the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. Warfarin can be an inconvenient agent that requires several days to achieve a therapeutic effect, requires monitoring of PT/INR to adjust dose, and has many drug and food interactions that can hinder patient compliance and render maintaining a therapeutic effect challenging. The direct-acting agents are easier to use and achieve reliable anticoagulation promptly without requiring dosage adjustment based on blood tests. Antiplatelet agents alone are generally not sufficient. For patients who cannot take anticoagulant medications, clopidogrel plus aspirin was compared to aspirin alone in the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE-A). Clopidogrel combined with aspirin was more effective than aspirin alone in preventing vascular events, principally stroke, but increased the risk of major bleeding. Uptodate recommends DOACs rather than vit K antagonist (Warfarin). - Harrison's 21st p7046, p12162, UpToDate"

        ],
         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, which is a medical emergency. The first step in the diagnosis of AMI is to obtain an ECG, which should be done and interpreted with in the first 10 minutes of patient's arrival. It can show characteristic changes such as ST-segment elevation, Q waves, or T wave inversion. Cardiac markers, such as troponin and creatine kinase-MB, are useful to confirm the diagnosis of AMI, but they may not be elevated in the early stages of the event. Echocardiogram can assess the cardiac function and wall motion abnormalities, but it is not as sensitive or specific as ECG for AMI. Coronary angiography is the gold standard for identifying the coronary artery occlusion and determining the revascularization strategy, but it is not the initial test for AMI. - UpToDate, Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p336"

         explanation: "In a diabetic patient with no cardiac symptoms, an ECG is the most appropriate preoperative investigation. Diabetes is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, and an ECG can help detect any silent ischemia or previous myocardial infarction. The primary rationale for obtaining a preoperative ECG in stable patients comes from the utility of having a baseline ECG should a postoperative ECG be abnormal. The preoperative ECG should be evaluated for the presence of prominent Q waves or significant ST-segment deviation (which raises the possibility of myocardial ischemia or infarction), as well as chamber abnormality/hypertrophy, QTc prolongation, bundle branch block, or arrhythmias. A chest X-ray (CXR) or echocardiogram (Echo) would not be necessary unless the patient has symptoms suggestive of other cardiac or pulmonary conditions. - UpToDate"

         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of acute heart failure due to chronic RHD. Pneumonia is a common precipitating factor for heart failure exacerbation, as it causes increased pulmonary congestion, hypoxemia, and systemic inflammation. Rheumatic fever is unlikely in the absence of fever, joint pain, or rash. Atrial fibrillation, mitral valve stenosis, and mitral valve regurgitation are complications of RHD that may contribute to heart failure, but they are not acute triggers.

            'Oral penicillin twice daily for 5 years or until age 18, whichever is longer',
        ],
         explanation: "The mainstay of controlling ARF and RHD is secondary prevention. This patient has ARF with carditis, which puts her at high risk of developing rheumatic heart disease and recurrent ARF. Secondary prophylaxis with benzathine penicillin is recommended to prevent streptococcal infections and reduce the risk of RHD progression. The duration of prophylaxis depends on the severity of carditis, the age of the patient, and the risk of exposure to streptococcus. For patients with ARF and carditis, the American Heart Association guidelines recommend benzathine penicillin G (1.2 million units, or 600,000 units if ≤27 kg) delivered every 4 weeks. It can be given every 3 weeks, or even every 2 weeks, to persons considered to beat particularly high risk, although in settings where good compliance with an every-4-week dosing schedule can be achieved, more frequent dosing is rarely needed. Oral penicillin V (250 mg) can be given twice daily instead but is less effective than benzathine penicillin G. Penicillin-allergic patients can receive erythromycin (250mg) twice daily. every 4 weeks. The duration of treatment is 10 years after last attack or 21 years of age (whichever is longer) if the patient has carditis (our patient has MR), and 5 years after last attack or 21 years of age (whichever is longer) if the patient has carditis Ideally, primary prevention would entail elimination of the major risk factors for streptococcal infection, particularly overcrowded housing. This is difficult to achieve in most places where ARF is common. - Harrison's 21st p10080, UpToDate"

            'Ventilation-perfusion scan',
            'Pulmonary angiography',
        ],
         explanation: "Hallmark of PE is dyspnea unexplained by auscultation. Tachycardia is the commonest and most sensitive ECG finding. S1Q3T3 (dominant s wave on lead one, q wave and inverted T-wave on lead 3), RV strain are also suggestive of PE. This patient has a high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism, based on her history, symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings. CT angiography is the preferred diagnostic test for PE, as it has high sensitivity and specificity, and can also evaluate other causes of chest pain and dyspnea. Helical CT scan is a non-contrast-enhanced scan that can detect large central PE, but it has low sensitivity for peripheral PE and cannot exclude alternative diagnoses. Ventilation-perfusion scan is an alternative test for patients with contraindications to contrast or renal impairment, but it may yield indeterminate results in patients with pre-existing lung disease. Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for PE diagnosis, but it is invasive, expensive, and not widely available. -Harrison's 21st p7720-7724, Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th392, UpToDate"

The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but it may involve genetic and environmental factors. Sarcoidosis typically affects young adults, especially women and African Americans. The most common symptoms are fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea, but some patients may be asymptomatic. Chest X-ray is the initial test of choice, and it may show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a hallmark of sarcoidosis.

Low-risk patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics, such as a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) or a doxycycline. Moderate-risk patients may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics, such as a beta-lactam (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., levofloxacin) alone. High-risk patients may need ICU admission and broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam.

It is most commonly caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in unvaccinated children, but other bacteria, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, can also cause epiglottitis. The typical presentation of epiglottitis is a child with high fever, drooling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and respiratory distress. The child may adopt a tripod position, sitting upright with the neck extended and the mouth open, to maximize the airway. Physical examination may reveal inspiratory stridor, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis. A lateral neck X-ray may show a thumbprint sign, which is a swollen epiglottis protruding into the airway Croup is the most common cause of UAO in children, but it causes a characteristic barking cough and a steeple sign on X-ray, which is a narrowing of the subglottic trachea.

         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV and low CD4 counts. The most important initial management for PCP is oxygen supplementation, as hypoxemia is the main predictor of mortality. Prednisolone and cotrimoxazole are used as adjunctive therapy to reduce inflammation and prevent bacterial superinfection, but they are not sufficient to treat PCP. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the first-line antibiotic for PCP given either IV or PO for 14 days to non-HIV-infected patients with mild disease and for 21 days to all other patients, and pentamidine is an alternative for patients who are allergic or intolerant to TMP-SMX. However, these drugs should be started after oxygen therapy and after ruling out other causes of pneumonia, such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, which may require different antibiotics or antifungals. These kind of questions are tricky, one might go stright to Cotrimoxazole as an answer which is also true, but the question clearly states the initial step of managment which is ABCD of life (Oxygen being a part of it). -Harrison's 21st p6326, UpToDate"

Since the patient is already on SABA the most effective next pharmacological treatment for acute asthma exacerbations is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, which reduce airway inflammation and improve bronchodilation. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is used as a maintenance therapy for mild to moderate persistent asthma, but it has no role in acute exacerbations.

         explanation: "Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. The patient's symptoms of excessive thirst and urination, combined with a lack of response in urine osmolality after administration of vasopressin, are indicative of NDI. In NDI, despite the presence of ADH, the kidneys do not concentrate urine, leading to a low urine osmolality and excessive urine output. Psychogenic polydipsia involves excessive water intake but would typically present with a low serum sodium level due to dilution, unlike our patient here. Central diabetes insipidus involves a deficiency in ADH production or release from the CNS. It typically responds to vasopressin administration. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is associated with hyponatremia and concentrated urine, which is also not consistent with the patient's presentation. - Harrison's 21st p10651, UpToDate"

HUS is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), especially serotype 0157:H7, which is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Shiga toxin damages the endothelial cells of the glomeruli and other organs, leading to hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure.

         explanation: "This patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which is defined as a rapid decline in renal function, resulting in an increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in urine output. AKI can be classified into three categories: prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal, depending on the location of the insult. Prerenal AKI is caused by decreased renal perfusion due to hypovolemia, hypotension, or decreased cardiac output. In this patient, severe diarrhea and vomiting have led to volume depletion and hypotension, which have reduced the blood flow to the kidneys and impaired their function. Prerenal AKI is usually reversible if the underlying cause is corrected promptly. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a type of intrinsic AKI that is caused by damage to the renal tubular cells due to ischemia or nephrotoxins. ATN typically occurs after prolonged or severe prerenal AKI, or in the setting of sepsis, rhabdomyolysis, or contrast-induced nephropathy. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is another type of intrinsic AKI that is caused by inflammation of the renal interstitium due to allergic reactions, infections, or drugs. AIN usually presents with fever, rash, eosinophilia, and urinary eosinophils. Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) is also a type of intrinsic AKI that is caused by inflammation of the glomeruli due to immune-mediated or infectious processes.

        ],
         explanation: "This neonate has primary hypothyroidism, which is defined as a deficiency of thyroid hormone due to a defect in the thyroid gland. Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by elevated TSH and low or normal free T4 levels. It is the most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism, which affects about 1 in 3000 newborns and is screened for in all neonates. The most common cause of primary hypothyroidism is thyroid dysgenesis, which is a developmental anomaly of the thyroid gland, resulting in agenesis, ectopy, or hypoplasia. Other causes include thyroid dyshormonogenesis, which is a defect in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone, or iodine deficiency, which is rare in developed countries. Normal variation in neonate is not a correct answer, as neonates have higher TSH and lower free T4 levels than adults, but not to the extent seen in this neonate. Transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity is a condition of low free T4 and normal TSH levels in preterm infants, due to immature hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and nonthyroidal illness. It is usually asymptomatic and resolves spontaneously. Maternal thyroid disease is a cause of transient congenital hypothyroidism, due to transplacental passage of maternal thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (in Graves' disease) or antithyroid drugs (in Hashimoto's thyroiditis). It usually presents with low TSH and high free T4 levels, and it resolves after the maternal antibodies or drugs are cleared from the neonate's circulation. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p5231 & p5237"

        ],
         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which is defined as an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. Hyperthyroidism can be caused by various conditions that stimulate the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone, such as Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism is characterized by suppressed TSH and elevated free T4 and/or free T3 levels. The best parameter to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is free T4, as it reflects the biologically active fraction of thyroid hormone that is not bound to serum proteins. Free T4 is more sensitive and specific than total T4, which can be affected by changes in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Free T3 is also a useful parameter to diagnose hyperthyroidism, especially in cases of T3 toxicosis, where free T4 levels may be normal. However, free T3 is less reliable than free T4, as it can be influenced by nonthyroidal illness, drugs, or nutritional factors. Total T3 is also less accurate than free T4, as it can be affected by TBG levels and other factors. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are markers of autoimmune thyroid disease, such as Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but they are not diagnostic of hyperthyroidism, as they can be present in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients as well."

GOO can be caused by various conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, or Crohn's disease. GOO can lead to acid-base and electrolyte disturbances, such as hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, due to the loss of gastric acid and fluids through vomiting. Gastric acid contains hydrochloric acid (HCI) and potassium (K+), vomiting leads to a decrease in serum chloride (Cl-) and potassium levels.

Although endoscopy is the most sensitive diagnostic test for peptic ulcer, it is not a cost-effective strategy in young patients with ulcer like dyspeptic symptoms unless endoscopy is available at low cost. Patients with suspected peptic ulcer should be evaluated for H. pylori infection. Serology (past or present infection), urea breath testing (current infection), and stool tests are noninvasive and less costly than endoscopy with biopsy. Endoscopy with biopsy is invasive and costly, and not indicated in asymptomatic patients.

It is a simple and effective method of managing perforated peptic ulcers, but it does not address the underlying cause of the ulcer. After a perforated peptic ulcer is surgically managed, it is crucial to address the underlying causes that may have contributed to the ulcer formation to prevent recurrence. Testing and treating H. pylori is recommended because if the infection is present, it can lead to ulcer recurrence and other complications. Highly selective vagotomy is a procedure that involves cutting the vagal nerve fibers that stimulate acid secretion, but it is rarely performed nowadays due to the availability of effective medical therapy. Repeat endoscopy is recommended in 6-8 weeks to assess the healing of the ulcer and to exclude malignancy. NSAIDs should be discontinued if possible, and misoprostol may be used as a prophylactic agent in high-risk patients, but these measures are not sufficient to prevent recurrence of ulcers. - UpToDate, Schwartz's 11th p1212"

Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins, which protect the gastric mucosa from acid and pepsin. Stopping aspirin may relieve her symptoms, but it would also increase her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, the best option is to continue aspirin and start omeprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion and heals esophagitis. Stopping aspirin could increase the risk of cardiovascular events, which is not advisable without a clear indication to do so.

The risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HBV is high, especially if the HBV DNA level is > 200,000 IU/mL. The recommended strategy to prevent MTCT is to administer HBIG and HBV vaccine to the newbom within 12 hours of birth, and to start antiviral prophylaxis with TDF for the mother in the third trimester if the HBV DNA level is > 200 IU/mL. Long-term antiviral treatment is not indicated for this patient, as she is asymptomatic and has normal liver function. Cesarean section delivery does not reduce the risk of MTCT. - William's Obstetrics 26th p2670-2671, gabe p1005, Harrison's 21st p 9428-9429"

He says that the bulge becomes more prominent when he coughs or strains, and that he can sometimes push it back into his abdomen. He has no history of abdominal surgery or trauma. On physical examination, the bulge is located below the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral pulse. It does not extend into the scrotum. The bulge increases in size with the Valsalva maneuver.

         explanation: "This patient has a femoral hernia, which is a protrusion of abdominal contents through the femoral ring, below the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral vessels. Femoral hemias are more common in women, but can occur in men as well. They present as painless groin masses that increase in size with increased intra-abdominal pressure. They have a high risk of incarceration and strangulation, and require surgical repair. In contrast, direct and indirect inguinal hernias protrude through the inguinal canal, with direct hernias protruding through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and indirect hernias protruding through the inguinal ring.

         explanation: "This patient has esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor arising from the glandular cells of the esophagus. The main risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma is chronic GERD, which causes damage to the squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus and its replacement by columnar epithelium with goblet cells, a condition known as Barrett esophagus. Barrett esophagus is a type of metaplasia, which is a reversible change of one cell type to another in response to chronic irritation. However, Barrett esophagus can progress to dysplasia, which is a precancerous lesion characterized by abnormal cell growth and differentiation. Dysplasia can then evolve to adenocarcinoma, which is an invasive malignancy with atypical nuclei and loss of normal tissue architecture. Therefore, the biopsy findings of this patient are consistent with adenocarcinoma, not metaplasia or dysplasia. Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of esophageal cancer, but it arises from the squamous epithelium and is associated with smoking, alcohol, and hot beverages. - Harrison's 21st p10126, UpToDate"

            'Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and change the dressing daily',
        ],
         explanation: "This patient has signs of wound infection, which is a common complication of appendectomy, especially in cases of perforation. The best treatment for wound infection is wound exploration, imigation, and debridement of any devitalized tissue, followed by packing or leaving the wound open to heal by secondary intention. Antibiotics are usually not indicated unless there is evidence of systemic infection or cellulitis. Laparotomy is not necessary unless there is suspicion of intra-abdominal abscess or peritonitis. Plastic surgery referral is not required for wound closure, as most wounds will heal with conservative management. Wound infections continue to represent a major medical problem, both in terms of how they affect the outcome of surgical procedures (surgical site infections), and for their impact on the length of hospital stay and medical costs. Infections can weaken an abdominal closure or hernia repair and result in wound dehiscence or recurrence of the hemia. Cosmetically, infections can lead to disfiguring, unsightly, or delayed closures. Anatomically, wound infections can be classified as superficial incisional, deep incisional, and organ/space wound infections, involving fascia, muscle, or the abdominal cavity. About three-fourths of all wound infections are superficial, involving skin and subcutaneous tissue only. Clinical diagnosis is easy when a postoperative wound looks edematous and erythematous and is tender. The aim of surgical treatment is thorough removal of all necrosed skin and fascia. If viable skin overlies necrotic fascia, multiple longitudinal skin incisions can be made to allow for excision of the devitalized fascia.Although removal of all necrotic tissue is the goal of the first surgical intervention, the distinction between necrotic and simply edematous tissue often is difficult. Careful inspection every 12 to 24 hours will reveal any new necrotic areas, and these need further debridement and excision. When all necrotic tissue has been removed and the infection has been controlled, the wounds may be covered with homo-or xenografts until definitive reconstruction and autografting can take place. The appropriate treatment of localised SSIs is interventional radiological drainage of pus or open drainage and debridement.- Schwartz's 11th p316, Bailey 25th p46, UpToDate"

The abdominal x-ray shows a characteristic 'coffee bean' sign, which is a dilated loop of colon with its apex pointing to the right upper quadrant. The initial management of sigmoid volvulus is resuscitation followed by endoscopic or rectal tube detorsion, which can decompress the bowel and untwist the volvulus in up to 80% of cases. Nasogastric tube insertion is not helpful, as it does not reach the site of obstruction. Colonoscopy can be used as a second-line option if rectal tube insertion fails, or as a diagnostic tool if the diagnosis is uncertain. Barium enema is contraindicated, as it can worsen the obstruction and increase the risk of perforation. Laparotomy is reserved for cases with signs of ischemia, necrosis, or perforation, or for recurrent or refractory volvulus. - Bailey 25th p1200, Schwartz's 11th p1334"

         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of a flare-up of Crohn disease, which is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly involves the terminal ileum. The palpable mass in the right iliac fossa and the CT findings of a thickened terminal ileum with fat stranding and enlarged lymph nodes suggest an inflammatory process, which is characteristic of Crohn's disease. Appendiceal abscess is an accumulation of pus due to an infection, typically following acute appendicitis. Patients with an appendiceal abscess often present with acute abdominal pain that begins around the navel and then shifts to the lower right abdomen. Fever, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea may accompany the pain. Ileocecal tuberculosis is a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis that affects the digestive system. It can mimic Crohn's disease but usually occurs in areas where tuberculosis is endemic or in immunocompromised patients. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. A definitive diagnosis would require evidence of M.tuberculosis from biopsy or culture. Psoas abscess is a collection of pus in the psoas muscle compartment, which can be primary (from a blood-borne infection) or secondary (from a nearby infectious source).

         explanation: "This patient has right-sided colon cancer, which is a malignant tumor arising from the glandular cells of the colon. The standard surgical treatment for right-sided colon cancer is right hemicolectomy, which involves the removal of the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, and proximal transverse colon, along with the associated lymph nodes and blood vessels. This provides adequate margins and lymphadenectomy, and reduces the risk of recurrence and metastasis. Right colectomy, segmental resection of the hepatic flexure, and transverse colectomy are less preferred options for this patient. These procedures may not provide adequate lymphadenectomy or may leave residual disease, increasing the risk of local recurrence. Segmental resection of the hepatic flexure would involve removing only the section of the colon containing the tumor. However, it may not provide an adequate margin or lymph node sampling, which is crucial for staging and treatment of colon cancer. Transverse colectomy procedure involves removing only the transverse colon. Since the tumor is located at the hepatic flexure, which is part of the right colon, a transverse colectomy would not be adequate for this case. It may not provide adequate lymphadenectomy or may leave residual disease, increasing the risk of local recurrence. - Bailey 25th p1183, Schwartz's 11th p1297-1298, UpToDate"

         explanation: "This patient has signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, which causes a megaloblastic anemia and neurological dysfunction. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disorder that impairs the absorption of vitamin B12 by destroying the gastric parietal cells that produce intrinsic factor (causing severe lack of IF as a result of gastric atrophy). Oral vitamin B12 supplements are not effective in pernicious anemia, as they require intrinsic factor for absorption. The treatment of choice is intramuscular vitamin B12 injections. Tropical sprue is a malabsorptive disorder that affects the small intestine, leading to nutrient absorption issues. It primarily occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and is believed to be related to bacterial or parasitic infections2. However, it typically presents with symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss.- Harrison's 21st p2962 Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and folate3. However, it does not typically cause vitamin B12 deficiency, as vitamin B12 is absorbed in the upper part of the small intestine, which is less commonly affected in celiac disease. Folate deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia similar to vitamin B12 deficiency. However, folate deficiency does not cause the neurological symptoms seen in vitamin B12 deficiency and would not explain the patient's low serum vitamin B12 level. - Harrison's 21st p2958 & p2970-2971, UpToDate"

         explanation: "The presence nce of Auer rods in the peripheral blood smear is a characteristic feature of AML, which is a malignant proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. Auer rods are needle-shaped inclusions in the cytoplasm of myeloid cells, and their presence is pathognomonic for AML.. AML. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, bleeding gums, recurrent infections, and easy bruising are consistent with the clinical presentation of AML. The complete blood count showing leukocytosis with 80% blasts also supports this diagnosis. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder characterized by a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and their precursors. It's associated with the Philadelphia chromo chromosome (t(9;22)(q34;q11)), which results in the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Patients may present with fatigue, weight loss, and splenomegaly, but they typically do not have a high percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood unless in blast crisis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults in Western countries and is characterized by a clonal proliferation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes. It's often an incidental finding on a blood test showing lymphocytosis. Symptoms, if present, might include fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly.CLL does not present with Auer rods or a high percentage of blasts. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of lymphoid lineage cells, often presenting in childhood. It's characterized by the presence of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Symptoms can include bone pain, lymphadenopathy, and CNS involvement. Like AML, ALL presents with a high percentage of blasts, but these blasts are of lymphoid origin, and Auer bodies are not seen. - Harrison's 21st p3107 & p3119 (Fig 104-1), UpToDate"

Screening tests of hemostasis, including the PT, aPTT, thrombin time (TT), and platelet count, are appropriate for all patients with suspected hemophilia. In hemophilia the platelet count, bleeding time, PT and aPTT are normal. Treatment of hemophilia bleeds requires: (1) prompt initiation of factor replacement (factor VIII and factor IX) as symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding, especially for classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a reliable patient, headaches, or major trauma; and (2) avoidance of antiplatelet drugs. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Individuals with VWD can have a normal CBC, aPTT, PT. Plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) measures the quantity of VWF protein in the plasma. Due to platelete aggregation defect bleeding time is usually prolonged in vWD. The mainstay of treatment for type 1 VWD is DDAVP (desmopressin), which results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores. - Harrison's 21st p3465 &p3455, UpToDate"

With suspected DVT, the initial diagnostic test recommended is compression U/S of the proximal leg veins (ACOG, 2020b). The diagnosis is based on the non-compressibility and typical echo architecture of a thrombosed vein. The best management for DVT in pregnancy is anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), which is safe and effective for both the mother and the fetus. Unfractionated heparin can also be used, but it requires more frequent monitoring and has more side effects than LMWH. UFHs are the initial treatment of thromboembolism and in situations in which delivery, surgery, or thrombolysis may be necessary.

FNAC can differentiate between reactive, inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic causes of lymphadenopathy, and guide further management. Excisional biopsy is a more invasive procedure that can provide more tissue for histologic and immunohistochemical analysis, but it is usually reserved for cases where FNAC is inconclusive or unavailable.

S. pneumoniae can also cause pharyngitis, especially in patients with underlying cardiac conditions, such as rheumatic heart disease, that predispose them to endocarditis. S. pyogenes is another common cause of pharyngitis, but it appears as gram-positive cocci in chains on Gram stain. S. aureus is a gram-positive coccus in clusters that can cause skin and soft tissue infections, as well as toxic shock syndrome. N. gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that can cause sexually transmitted infections, such as urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. - Harrison's 21st p4381"

            'Intracerebral hematoma',
        ],
         explanation: "Epidural hematomas are the result of blood collecting in the potential space between the skull and the dura mater. Most epidural hematomas result from blunt trauma to the temporal or temporoparietal area with an associated skull fracture and middle meningeal artery disruption. The classic history of an epidural hematoma is a lucid period following immediate loss of consciousness in the setting of significant blunt head trauma. However, this clinical pattem occurs in a minority of cases. Most patients either never lose consciousness or never regain consciousness after the injury. On CT scan, epidural hematomas appear lenticular or biconvex (football shaped), typically in the temporal region. The high-pressure arterial bleeding of an epidural hematoma can lead to herniation within hours after injury. Therefore, early recognition and evacuation are important to increase survival. Bilateral ED trephination (burr holes) is rarely, if ever, performed and should only be considered if definitive neurosurgical care is not available. Subdural hematomas appear as hyperdense, crescent-shaped lesions that cross suture lines. They result from a collection of blood below the dura and over the brain. To differentiate the CT finding from an epidural hematoma, think about the high pressure created by the arterial tear of an epidural that causes the hematoma to expand inward. In contrast, the low-pressure venous bleed of a subdural hematoma layers along the calvarium. Traumatic SAH is probably the most common CT abnormality in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury. Intracerebral hematornas (d) and contusions occur secondary to traumatic tearing of intracerebral blood vessels. Contusions most commonly occur in the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes. They may occur either at the site of the blunt trauma or on the opposite site of the brain, known as a contrecoup injury. - Examples of each are shown in the figure (subdural, traumatic SAH, and cerebral hematoma/contusion, respectively - Schwartz's 11th p223-224, Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p1685-1686, utd",

         explanation: "Fat embolism syndrome is a rare complication of long bone fractures, orthopedic surgery, or liposuction, that occurs when fat globules enter the circulation and cause mechanical obstruction and inflammatory reaction in the pulmonary and systemic capillaries. It is characterized by a triad of respiratory distress, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash, which manifests as early as 12hrs or as late as 2wks usually within 24 to 72 hours after the injury or procedure. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and supportive findings, such as hypoxemia, diffuse infiltrates on chest x-ray, fat droplets in urine or sputum, and thrombocytopenia. The treatment is supportive, with oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and corticosteroids. Pulmonary embolism is another possible complication of long bone fractures, but it would show a wedge-shaped infarct or pleural effusion on chest x-ray, and a positive D-dimer test. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that can be caused by various insults, such as sepsis, trauma, or aspiration, but it is unlikely in this patient without a clear trigger. - Bailey 25th p912, Harrison's 21st p7718, UpToDate"

It is caused by the release of endotoxins from the dying bacteria, which trigger an inflammatory response. It is characterized by fever, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and history of antibiotic therapy. The treatment is supportive, with antipyretics, analgesics, and fluids. Anaphylactic shock is a type of distributive shock that results from a severe allergic reaction mediated by IgE antibodies. It is characterized by urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, and hypotension. Septic shock is a type of distributive shock that results from a systemic inflammatory response to an infection.

         explanation: "Hyperkalemia, or high blood potassium levels, can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. The patient's lab results show a potassium level of 6.5 mEq/L, which is higher than the normal range (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L). The ECG changes, specifically the peaked T-waves, are also indicative of hyperkalemia. Mild increases in extracellular K+ affect the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential, resulting inchanges in T-wave morphology. While encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, and pulmonary edema can occur in patients with acute kidney injury, they are typically not the immediate cause of death. Hyperkalemia is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent fatal cardiac complications. The treatment of hyperkalemia is divided into three stages: 1. Immediate antagonism of the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia. IV calcium gluconate/ calcium chloride. 2. Rapid reduction in plasma K+ concentration by redistribution into cells. This can be done by administering Insulin and ẞ2-Agonists. 3. Removal of potassium. This is typically accomplished using cation exchange resins, diuretics, and/or dialysis. -Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th91, Harrison's 21st p1441-1446, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is an immune-mediated kidney injury that occurs 1-4 weeks after a strep infection. It is not prevented by antibiotics because it is caused by preformed antibodies that cross-react with the kidney. Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS) is characterized by sudden onset of shock, organ failure, and frequently death. Antibiotic therapy is crucial in the management of STSS. Management is Penicillin G plus clindamycin plus IV immunoglobulin Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection that causes the death of parts of the body's soft tissue.

         explanation: "Gonococcal arthritis is a complication of disseminated gonococcal infection, which typically affects young, sexually active individuals. It presents with a triad of tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and polyarthralgia, or with a monoarticular septic arthritis. The diagnosis is confirmed by culture or nucleic acid amplification test of the urethral discharge and/or synovial fluid. Treatment involves intravenous or intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin. The most likely diagnosis for a urethral discharge, knee joint swelling, and a history of unprotected sex, along with the findings of purulent discharge at the urethral meatus, a warm, tender, and swollen left knee, and synovial fluid analysis showing numerous neutrophils and intracellular gram-negative diplococci, is Gonococcal arthritis. The presence of intracellular gram-negative diplococci in the synovial fluid is characteristic of gonococcal infection. Reactive arthritis is a sterile arthritis that occurs after gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections. It is associated with the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (Reiter's syndrome). However, the presence of bacteria in the synovial fluid would not be consistent with reactive arthritis. Septic arthritis is an infection within the joint space, most commonly caused by bacteria. While the symptoms may be similar to those of gonococcal arthritis, septic arthritis is more often caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and would not typically present with a sexually transmitted infection. Gouty arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints, leading to an acute inflammatory response. It would not be associated with urethral discharge or a sexually transmitted infection, and the synovial fluid would show needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals under polarized light, not bacteria. -Harrison's 21st p4646, Apley Orthopedics 10th p50"

It can be caused by various conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, diabetes, or trauma. It presents with swelling, pain, and reduced range of motion of the affected tendon. Treatment involves rest, immobilization, anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections. Patients with infectious FTS present with pain, redness, and fever. Physical examination reveals Kanavel's 'cardinal' signs of flexor tendon sheath infection: finger held in slight flexion, fusiform swelling, tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, and pain over the flexor sheath with passive extension of the digit. Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection that causes swelling, pain, warmth, and redness of the affected area. However, the patient does not have symptoms of warmth or erythema, which are typically seen in cellulitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone caused by bacteria or fungi. The patient's symptoms do not suggest a bone infection, making this diagnosis less likely. Dupuytren contracture causes one or more fingers to bend toward the palm due to the development of fibrous connective tissue between the tendons of the finger.

        ],
         explanation: "The treatment of hypertension in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage includes nicardipine, labetalol, and esmolol. Nicardipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to lower blood pressure in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. It has a rapid onset and offset of action, and can be titrated easily to achieve the target blood pressure. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend lowering the systolic blood pressure to < 140 mmHg in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage who have a systolic blood pressure of 150-220 mmHg. Therapy goal is, if SBP >220 mm Hg, consider aggressive management with IV infusion. If SBP 150-220 mm Hg, IV boluses of antihypertensive medications should be used to acutely lower SBP to 140 mm Hg. Hydralazine and nifedipine are not recommended because they can cause reflex tachycardia and cerebral vasodilation, which may worsen the bleeding. Enalaprilat use: there is concerns of precipitous blood pressure drop. - Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p404, Harrison's 21st p12175, UpToDate"

He says that the tremor is worse when he tries to write, eat, or drink, and that it improves with alcohol consumption. He also has a mild tremor of his head and voice. His father had a similar condition. On physical exam, he has a bilateral postural tremor of his hands with a frequency of 8 Hz. There is no rigidity, bradykinesia, or ataxia.

        ],
         explanation: "Patients with Parkinson's usually have tremors when they're at rest, but essential tremor generally has tremors during movement, typically occurs while trying to sustain a posture coupled with an action tremor, and cerebellar dysfunction characterized by a kinetic tremor (brought out by trying to touch an object) and is usually associated with hypotonia and past pointing. Beta blockers and primidone are the standard drug therapies for ET and are useful in about 50% of cases. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can reduce the amplitude and frequency of essential tremor. It is the first-line pharmacological treatment for essential tremor, especially when it affects the hands, head, or voice. Levodopa is the mainstay of treatment for parkinsonian tremor, but has no effect on essential tremor. Clonazepam and primidone are second-line agents for essential tremor, but they have more side effects than propranolol, such as sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependence. - Harrison's 21st p12358-12360, UpToDate"

        ],
         explanation: "Tonsillopharyngitis is an acute infection of the pharynx, palatine tonsils, or both. The patient's symptoms of a sore throat and fever are consistent with tonsillopharyngitis. It's a common cause of febrile seizures in children, especially those between 6 months and 5 years of age. Febrile seizures are usually benign and self-limited, and do not require antiepileptic drugs. CSF analysis is normal in febrile seizures, unless there is an underlying CNS infection. Viral meningitis is inflammation of the meninges to a viral infection. Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, sensitivity to light, and neck stiffness. However, the patient's CSF analysis is normal, which makes this diagnosis less likely as CSF analysis would typically show changes in cases of meningitis. Viral encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma caused by a virus. While the patient does have a fever and experienced a seizure, the lack of other neurological symptoms and the normal CSF analysis make this diagnosis less likely. Bacterial meningitis is a serious infection causing inflammation of the meninges, typically resulting from a bacterial infection. Symptoms can include fever, headache, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. However, similar to viral meningitis, the normal CSF analysis in this patient makes bacterial meningitis an unlikely diagnosis. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p5554-5557, UpToDate"

        ],
         explanation: "The patient's presentation of sudden onset right-sided weakness without sensory loss or aphasia is indicative of a pure motor hemiparesis. This type of stroke typically occurs due to a lacunar infarction affecting the posterior limb of the internal capsule, where the corticospinal tract is located. Since the motor fibers are crossed, a lesion in the left hemisphere will cause right-sided weakness. The internal capsule is a common site for small vessel ischemic stroke, especially in patients with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. A lesion of the corona radiata would cause similar symptoms, but it would also affect the cortical areas and produce a larger infarct on CT scan. The absence of sensory deficits makes the corona radiata less likely, as it contains both motor and sensory fibers. The basal ganglia, and thalamus are subcortical structures that have movement disorders, changes in posture, and sometimes cognitive and emotional disturbances. - Harrison's 21st p12148, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, as it contributes to atherosclerosis, endothelial damage, and vascular remodeling. The patient has a history of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a brief episode of focal neurological dysfunction due to ischemia, without infarction. TIAs are often caused by emboli from atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries. Other modifiable risk factors for stroke include dyslipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and oral contraceptive use. Hypertension is the most significant of the risk factors; in general, all hypertension should be treated to a target of <130/80 mmHg. Recent data (the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial-SPRINT) suggest that lowering SBP <120 mmHg reduces stroke and heart attack by 43% compared to SBP <140 mmHg, without an increased risk of syncope or falls. - Harrison's 21st p12157"

         explanation: "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that causes ascending symmetric weakness, areflexia, and autonomic dysfunction. It is often preceded by an infection, such as Campylobacter jejuni, or a vaccination. It can affect the cranial nerves, causing facial weakness, dysphagia, and ophthalmoplegia. It can also cause respiratory failure due to diaphragmatic paralysis. The cerebrospinal fluid typically shows albuminocytologic dissociation, which is elevated protein and normal cell count. The diagnosis is confirmed by nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Treatment involves intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination in the CNS. It usually presents with episodes of neurological dysfunction (relapses) that can affect vision, sensation, balance, and muscle strength. The presentation is often more variable, and CSF findings can include oligoclonal bands, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, leading to fluctuating muscle weakness that worsens with activity. It typically does not cause areflexia or the CSF changes seen in this patient. Poliomyelitis is an acute viral infection that can lead to flaccid paralysis. However, it has been largely eradicated in many parts of the world due to vaccination, and the CSF findings would typically show an increase in cells, particularly lymphocytes. -Harrison's 21st p12718 & p12727, UpToDate"

            'Homer syndrome',
        ],
         explanation: "Brown-Séquard syndrome is a hemisection of the spinal cord that causes ipsilateral motor paralysis and loss of proprioception and vibration sensation, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion. It is usually caused by trauma, such as a penetrating injury, or spinal cord compression. The cranial nerves are spared, unless the lesion is at the level of the medulla. Cauda equina syndrome is most frequently associated with large central disc herniations at L4/5 and L5/S1. Patients typically describe numbness around the perineum and down the inside of the thighs (saddle paraesthesia) They may also be unable to pass urine and have loss of anal tone. If possible, imaging and surgery should be undertaken within hours of the onset of symptoms as the prognosis deteriorates rapidly over time. The central cord syndrome is usually seen in older patients with preexisting cervical spondylosis who sustain a hyperextension injury. The centrally located fibers of the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts are affected. The neural tracts providing function to the upper extremities are most medial in position compared with the thoracic, lower extremity, and sacral fibers that have a more lateral distribution. Clinically, patients with a central cord syndrome present with decreased strength and, to a lesser degree, decreased pain and temperature sensation, more in the upper than the lower extremities. Vibration and position sensation are usually preserved. Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) may also occur if the lesion affects the cervical sympathetic chain. - Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p1710, ATLS 10th p189, Schwartz's 11th p1872, Bailey 25th p313"

        ],
         explanation: "Three of the most common vestibular disorders are featured prominently in this chapter. These are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, and cerebellar/brainstem stroke. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in all clinical settings including the ED. The condition occurs when otoconia (which normally reside in the utricle) are displaced spontaneously or by trauma or infection into the semicircular canals. As a result, when patients move their head in certain positions, they experience vertigo and nystagmus, sometimes very intense, for less than 2 minutes, often around 20 seconds. BPPV can be diagnosed easily with a bedside test and is highly responsive to treatment with the Epley or other particle repositioning maneuvers. Dix-Hallpike Test is used to confirm the diagnosis of posterior canal BPPV, which is the most common form of BPPV. It is appropriate to perform a DHT if a patient has dizziness brought on by head movements only (such as rolling over in bed, lying down, or getting out of bed) that lasts 15 to 30 seconds and has no spontaneous or gaze-evoked nystagmus. Have the patient seated on a stretcher or bed and positioned so that when supine, the patient's neck can be extended 20 degrees. To observe for nystagmus, instruct the patient to keep the eyes open throughout the test, even if vertigo occurs. To test the left ear, have the patient turn the head 45 degrees to the left. The examiner then quickly brings the patient from a sitting position to a supine position, with the neck extended 20 degrees and head turned 45 degrees to the left. Wait 15 seconds, and if no vertigo or nystagmus occurs, sit the patient up. Test the right side in the same manner, with the head turned 45 degrees to the right.A positive DHT consists of a few seconds (up to 15) of latency, in which the patient is asymptomatic, followed by the onset of vertigo with a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of nystagmus that typical lasts roughly 15 to 30 seconds. - Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p1146-1147"

More than 50% of patients with clinical manifestations have intracerebral involvement. Clinical findings at presentation range from non-focal to focal dysfunction. CNS findings include encephalopathy, meningoencephalitis, and mass lesions. Patients may present with altered mental status (75%), fever (10-72%), seizures (33%), headaches (56%), and focal neurologic findings (60%), including motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, movement disorders, dysmetria, visual-field loss, and aphasia It typically presents, single and frequently multiple contrast-enhancing (<2 cm) lesions on MRI and is especially likely when the CD4 count falls below 100 cells/microL. By this test, may be identified. Primary CNS lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that originates in the brain, spinal cord, or meninges. It is more common in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, or patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs. It typically presents with headache, confusion, seizures, or focal neurological deficits. Brain MRI usually shows a single or multiple ring-enhancing lesions, often with perive penver periventricular involvement. The diagnosis can be confirmed by brain biopsy, which shows malignant lymphoid cells that are positive for CD20 and EBV. The treatment is a combination of high-dose methotrexate, rituximab, and whole-brain radiation therapy. Neurocysticercosis is an infection caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium and can cause cysts in the brain.

         explanation: "Fibroadenoma is a benign tumor of the breast that arises from the stromal and epithelial components of the terminal duct lobular unit. It is the most common benign breast tumor in young women. Fibroadenoma typically presents as a painless, mobile, well-circumscribed mass that may vary in size with the menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Mammography usually shows a round or oval mass with smooth margins and no calcifications. Histologically, fibroadenoma is composed of a proliferation of glandular and fibrous tissue, forming a biphasic pattern of ducts and stroma. The stroma is usually cellular and may show myxoid or hyaline degeneration. The ducts are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells and may show apocrine metaplasia. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts and has no symptoms. It is usually detected by a mammogram and appears as small clusters of calcifications that have irregular shapes and sizes. However, the mammogram in this case is not typical of DCIS. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands (lobules) of the breast. It often presents as a thickening in part of the breast rather than a discrete mass. It is less likely in this patient given the well-defined nature of the lump. Invasive ductal carcinoma: This is the most common type of breast cancer. It typically presents as a firm, irregular mass and may be associated with skin changes or nipple discharge, which are not described here. - Schwartz's 11th p578 & p590-592, Bailey 25th p836-838, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm that arises from the exocrine or endocrine cells of the pancreas. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which accounts for about 85% of cases. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma typically presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice due to obstruction of the bile duct by the tumor. KRAS is a member of the RAS family of GTPases (RAS/MAPK pathway), which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. KRAS mutation leads to constitutive activation of the downstream signaling pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, resulting in increased cell growth and resistance to apoptosis. Mutations in the KRAS gene are common in pancreatic cancer, especially in the context of chronic pancreatitis and heavy alcohol use. BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are more commonly associated with breast and ovarian cancers, but they can also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. TP53 mutation is associated with a variety of cancers123. The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p53 (or p53), which regulates cell division and DNA repair1. Mutations in the TP53 gene can cause cancer, such as lung cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. - Schwartz's 11th p1512, UpToDate"

It is more common in lactating women, due to nipple trauma, milk stasis, or mastitis. Breast abscess typically presents with a painful, warm, and erythematous lump in the breast, often associated with fever and malaise. Previously almost all breast abscesses were treated by operative incision and drainage, but now the initial approach is antibiotics and repeated aspiration of the abscess, usually ultrasound-guided aspiration. The initial management of breast abscess is to start antibiotics, such as dicloxacillin or clindamycin, and to continue breastfeeding or pumping to prevent milk stasis and engorgement. Incision of a lactational abscess is necessary if there is marked skin thinning and can usually be performed under local anaesthesia if an analgesic cream such as EMLA (lidocaine) is applied 30 min before surgery. If the abscess does not resolve with antibiotics, then incision and drainage may be indicated. Fine-needle aspiration can be used to confirm the diagnosis of abscess and to obtain a culture of the pus. Mammography is not indicated in lactating women, as it can cause false-positive results due to increased breast density. -Schwartz's 11th p577, Bailey 25th p833, MOH guideline 2020 p99"

         explanation: "Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) is a precancerous condition of the vagina, characterized by dysplasia of the squamous epithelium. It is usually caused by HPV infection, especially HPV types 16 and 18. VAIN is often asymptomatic and detected incidentally during colposcopy or Pap smear. It is rarely ound as a primary lesion and most o ten develops as an extension of CIN, mainly in the upper third of the vagina. Colposcopy can reveal areas of acetowhite epithelium, which are abnormal epithelial cells that turn white after application of acetic acid. Biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of VAIN and determine the grade of dysplasia. VAIN is classified into three grades: VAIN 1 (mild dysplasia., VAIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), and VAIN 3 (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ). The treatment of VAIN depends on the grade, extent, and location of the lesion, and may include topical therapy, laser ablation, or surgical excision. VAIN is a risk factor for developing invasive vaginal cancer, which is a rare malignancy that usually presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or mass. Vaginal cancer can be staged according to the TNM system, where stage 1 means, the tumor is confined to the vagina, stage 2 means the tumor has invaded the subvaginal tissue or the paravaginal tissue, stage 3 means the tumor has extended to the pelvic wall or the lower third of the urethra or the vagina, and stage 4 means the tumor has invaded the bladder, rectum, or beyond the true pelvis. - William's Gynecology 3rd p672, Current ObGyn 11th p1461, Novak's 15th p1101, Danforth p1959"

Two HPV vaccines are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) against HPV-16,-18,-6, and -11 and a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) against HPV-16 and-18. HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that can infect the cervix and cause dysplasia and neoplasia of the squamous epithelium. HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of cervical cancers. HPV vaccination can protect against these high-risk types, as well as other types that cause genital warts and other cancers. HPV vaccination is recommended for all girls and boys aged 11 to 12 years, with catch-up vaccination for those aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated. HPV vaccination can also be given to adults aged 27 to 45 years who are at increased risk of HPV infection, such as those who are sexually active with multiple partners, immunocompromised, or have a history of abnormal Pap smears. HPV vaccination does not eliminate the need for cervical cancer screening, as it does not protect against all HPV types. Pap smear is a screening test that can detect cervical dysplasia and cancer by examining the cells of the cervix. Pap smear is recommended for all women aged 21 to 65 years, with different intervals depending on the age and the results of previous tests. Pap smear can also be combined with HPV testing for women aged 30 to 65 years, which can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the screening.Condom use can reduce the risk of HPV transmission, but it is not a reliable method of prevention, as HPV can infect areas that are not covered by the condom. Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, which can be a treatment option for cervical cancer, but it is not a preventive measure. - Current ObGyn 11th p1471, William's Gynecology 3rd p684 & p707, Novak's 15th p2259-2260"

        question : "A 50-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding for the past 6 months. She also has pelvic pain, urinary frequency, and constipation. She has a history of fibroids and endometriosis. She has two children and does not want to have more. On physical examination, the uterus is enlarged and irregular. A pelvic ultrasound shows a 6-cm submucosal fibroid in the posterior wall of the uterus. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",

            'Myomectomy',
            'Uterine artery embolization',
        ],
         explanation: "Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, which can be a definitive treatment for fibroids, especially in women who have completed childbearing and have severe symptoms. Fibroids are benign tumors of the smooth muscle cells of the uterus, which can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, urinary frequency, constipation, and infertility. Fibroids can be classified according to their location in the uterus: submucosal (under the endometrium), intramural (within the myometrium), or subserosal (under the peritoneum). Submucosal fibroids are more likely to cause heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, as they distort the endometrial cavity and interfere with the normal contraction of the uterus. Cone biopsy treats cervical dysplasia or cancer, not fibroids. Myomectomy removes fibroids while preserving the uterus, which can be an option for women who wish to retain their fertility or avoid hysterectomy. However, myomectomy has the risk of recurrence of fibroids, as well as the risk of bleeding, infection, and adhesions. Uterine artery embolization, a minimally invasive procedure, blocks blood supply to fibroids, causing them to shrink. It carries risks including infection and impaired fertility. - Current ObGyn 11th p1212 & p1404, Novak's 15th p827, William's Gynecology 3rd p238"

        ],
         explanation: "OCD is a mental disorder characterized by persistent and unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that cause significant distress and impairment. The exact cause of OCD is unknown, but several risk factors have been identified, such as genetics, environmental factors, and brain alterations. Personality is one of the risk factors that may influence the development of OCD. People who score high on measures of neuroticism, perfectionism, or harm avoidance may be more prone to OCD. Neuroticism is a personality trait that reflects the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, anger, or depression. Perfectionism is a personality trait that reflects the tendency to set and pursue excessively high standards, and to be overly critical of oneself and others. Harm avoidance is a personality trait that reflects the tendency to avoid situations that may cause physical or psychological discomfort, and to be cautious and fearful of uncertainty. These personality traits may predispose people to OCD by making them more sensitive to stress, more vulnerable to intrusive thoughts, and more likely to engage in compulsive behaviors to reduce anxiety. Single is not a risk factor for OCD, as there is no evidence that marital status affects the prevalence or severity of OCD. Socioeconomic status is also not a risk factor for OCD, as there is no consistent association between income, education, or occupation and OCD.Gender is a risk factor for OCD only in childhood, as males are more likely to develop early-onset OCD, but not in adulthood, as the gender ratio is equal. Family history is a risk factor for OCD, as having parents or other relatives with OCD increases the likelihood of developing OCD, especially if the onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, in this case, the patient has no family history of OCD, so this is not the most likely risk factor. -DSM 5 p239-240, UpToDate"

PDD does not have psychotic features, and is less severe but more chronic than major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is a mental disorder characterized by at least one episode of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in most activities, lasting for at least 2 weeks, and accompanied by at least four other symptoms, such as low energy, poor concentration, insomnia or hypersomnia, weight loss or gain, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, suicidal ideation, or psychotic features. MDD with psychotic features is more severe and has a poorer prognosis than MDD without psychotic features. Schizoaffective disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a combination of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, and mood symptoms, such as depression or mania.

         explanation: "For pregnant patients with bipolar major depression, we suggest lamotrigine as first line treatment, and Quetiapine is comparable. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that can be used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder. Quetiapine has a low risk of causing birth defects or adverse effects on the fetus or the newborn, and is considered relatively safe during pregnancy. Quetiapine can also be used during breastfeeding, as it has a low concentration in breast milk and a low oral bioavailability in infants. Quetiapine can cause sedation, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, or orthostatic hypotension, but these side effects are usually mild and manageable. Lithium is a mood stabilizer that can be used to treat bipolar disorder, especially manic episodes. Lithium has a high risk of causing birth defects, such as Ebstein anomaly (CHD affecting the tricuspid valve), or neonatal toxicity, such as hypothyroidism, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, or cardiac arrhythmias. Lithium is contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy, and should be used with caution and close monitoring during the second and third trimesters. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that can be used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder. Olanzapine has a moderate risk of causing birth defects, such as neural tube defects, or neonatal complications, such as respiratory distress, hypotonia, or extrapyramidal symptoms. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication that can be used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder. Risperidone has a moderate risk of causing birth defects, such as neural tube defects, or neonatal complications, such as respiratory distress, hypotonia, or extrapyramidal symptoms. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication that can be used to treat bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or major depressive disorder.

Opioid withdrawal typically starts 6 to 12 hours after last use of short acting opioids and 30 hours after abstinence from long-acting opioids. Opioid withdrawal can be abruptly precipitated by the administration of antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone or the administration of partial agonist-antagonists such as buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, 0.3 to 1.2 milligrams IV or IM every 6 hours or 2 to 4 milligrams sublingual, can safely be administered to a medically ill opioid-dependent patient experiencing withdrawal who is being admitted to the hospital. No methadone or buprenorphine should be administered to an opioid-dependent patient until withdrawal symptoms appear.

The resulting compartment syndrome is most common in circumferential extremity burns, but abdominal and thoracic compartment syndromes also occur. Compartment syndrome is a condition in which increased pressure within a closed fascial space compromises the blood supply and function of the tissues within that space. It can be caused by trauma, burns, fractures, or ischemia. Circumferential burns can cause compartment syndrome by creating a tight band around the affected limb, restricting the blood flow and causing edema, pain, and ischemia. Compartment syndrome can lead to muscle necrosis, nerve damage, and limb loss if not treated promptly. The treatment of compartment syndrome is surgical fasciotomy, which involves cutting the fascia to relieve the pressure and restore the blood flow. - Schwartz's 11th p282 & p286, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Heroin is an opioid drug made from morphine, a natural substance taken from the seed pod of the various opium poppy plants grown in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist (Opioid toxicity antidote) that can reverse the effects of opioid overdose, such as respiratory depression, sedation, and miosis. Naloxone can be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intranasally, and has a rapid onset of action. Naloxone can restore the consciousness and respiration of the patient, but it may also precipitate withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, pain, nausea, and vomiting. Methadone is a synthetic opioid agonist that can be used to treat opioid dependence, as it can prevent withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. Methadone is not indicated for the treatment of acute opioid overdose, as it can worsen the condition and cause death. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to treat opioid dependence, as it can block the effects of opioids and reduce the reward and reinforcement of drug use. Naltrexone is not indicated for the treatment of acute opioid overdose, as it has a slow onset of action and may not be effective in reversing the respiratory depression.

The goals of therapy for alcohol withdrawal are to alleviate autonomic hyperactivity and agitation, halt progression to delirium tremens, and if possible, provide motivation for and access to detoxification to promote long-term abstinence. Initial therapy is usually with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, midazolam or lorazepam, which reduce the risk of seizures and delirium tremens. Areke is a traditional alcoholic beverage in Ethiopia, which would worsen the patient's condition. Disulfiram is an aversive agent that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and causes unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed. It is used for relapse prevention, not acute withdrawal.

Co-oximetry, which measures total hemoglobin as well as oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and COHb saturation, is the only accurate measurement tool. There is excellent correlation between arterial and venous COHb levels, and so a venous blood gas with co-oximetry is sufficient in most cases. Standard pulse oximetry is unreliable in the diagnosis of CO poisoning. - Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th1415-1417"

        question : "A term newborn boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress and abdominal distension. He was born to a 25-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, who had no prenatal care. The delivery was complicated complicated by meconium-stained amniotic fluid and fetal bradycardia. On examination, he has tachypnea, Intercostal retractions, and decreased breath sounds on the right side. His abdomen is distended and tympanic. A plain abdominal radiograph shows ground glass appearance in the right lower quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        options : [
            'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia',
            'Meconium ileus',
            'Hirschsprung disease',
            'Meconium aspiration syndrome',
        ],
         explanation: "Meconium ileus (plug) presents with abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life. The diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal radiograph, which shows a dilated colon filled with meconium and air-fluid levels, and a microcolon distal to the obstruction. These levels may be absent in patients with meconium ileus because the viscosity of the secretions in the proximal bowel prevents layering. Instead, a typical hazy or ground glass appearance may be appreciated in the right lower quadrant. This haziness is caused by small bubbles of gas that become trapped in inspissated meconium in the terminal ileal region. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm that allows the abdominal organs to herniate into the thoracic cavity, causing pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory distress. The diagnosis is confirmed by chest radiograph, which shows a mediastinal shift and air-filled loops of bowel in the thorax. Hirschsprung disease is a congenital absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, causing functional obstruction and failure of relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. Plain radiographs typically demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels proximal to the obstruction in the upright or lateral decubitus positions The diagnosis is confirmed by rectal biopsy, which shows absence of ganglion cells and hypertrophy of nerve fibers. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p3305"

        question : "A first day neonate is delivered by cesarean section because of fetal distress. The neonate has tachypnea, grunting, and intercostal retractions. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation and fluid in the fissures. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        options : [
            'Transient tachypnea of the newborn',
            'Meconium aspiration syndrome',
            'Hyaline membrane disease',
            'Pneumonia',
        ],
         explanation: "TTN is a common condition in neonates delivered by cesarean section, especially without labor. It is caused by delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. The symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours. Twin gestation, matemal asthma, late prematurity, precipitous delivery, gestational diabetes, and cesarean delivery without labor are common associated risk factors. Treatment for TTN is supportive. MAS is associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, fetal distress, and coarse crackles on auscultation. HMD is more common in preterm infants and is characterized by surfactant deficiency, atelectasis, and ground-glass appearance on chest x-ray. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p1471"

        question : "A neonate is born at 36 weeks of gestation with respiratory distress and cyanosis. The chest x-ray shows a mediastinal shift to the right, absence of the left hemidiaphragm, and bowel loops in the left hemithorax. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia',
        ],
         explanation: "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (BOCHDALEK) is a defect in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to herniate into the chest cavity, compressing the lung and displacing the heart. It is usually diagnosed prenatally or shortly after birth. CCAM is a hamartomatous lung lesion that may cause respiratory distress, but it does not cause mediastinal shift or bowel loops in the chest. Pulmonary sequestration is a non-functioning lung tissue that receives blood supply from the systemic circulation, but it is usually asymptomatic at birth. BPD is a chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm infants who received mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p1484"

        question : "A neonate is born at home and brought to the hospital on the second day of life because of poor feeding, lethargy, and fever. The neonate has generalized muscle rigidity, opisthotonus, and trismus. The mother did not receive any antenatal care or immunizations. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            'Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn',
            'Neonatal sepsis',
        ],
         explanation: "Neonatal tetanus is a fatal disease that is caused by Clostridium tetani infection of the umbilical stump. It is preventable by maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid. the infantile form of generalized tetanus, typically manifests within 3-12 days of birth. It presents as progressive difficulty in feeding, associated hunger, and crying. Paralysis or diminished movement, stiffness and rigidity to the touch, and spasms, with or without opisthotonos, are characteristic. The umbilical stump, which is typically the portal of entry for the microorganism, may retain remnants of dirt, dung, clotted blood, or serum, or it may appear relatively benign. Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is a bleeding disorder that results from vitamin K deficiency. It may present with ecchymoses, hematomas, or bleeding from the umbilicus, but it does not cause muscle spasms. Neonatal sepsis is a systemic infection that may cause fever, poor feeding, lethargy, and respiratory distress, but it does not cause rigidity or trismus. Congenital syphilis is a multisystem infection that may cause rash, snuffles, hepatosplenomegaly, and skeletal abnormalities, but it does not cause muscle spasms. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p2531"

        question : "A neonate is born at term to a mother with blood group O positive. The neonate develops jaundice on the second day of life, which progresses to the level of the sole. The neonate is otherwise well and feeding normally. The direct Coombs test is negative. What is the most likely cause of the jaundice?",
        options : [
            'Blood group incompatibility',
            'Rh incompatibility',
            'Breastfeeding jaundice',
            'Biliary atresia',
        ],
         explanation: "Breastfeeding jaundice is a common cause of physiological jaundice in the first week of life. It is due to suboptimal intake of breast milk, which leads to dehydration, increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, and decreased stool output. It usually resolves with adequate breastfeeding and hydration. Blood group incompatibility and Rh incompatibility are causes of hemolytic jaundice, which are associated with positive Coombs's test, anemia, and splenomegaly. Biliary atresia is a cause of obstructivej ive jaundice, which is characterized by acholic stools, dark urine, and hepatomegaly. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p542"

        question : "A preterm neonate is born at 28 weeks of gestation and weighs 1.2 kg. The neonate is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and receives parenteral nutrition and surfactant therapy. What is the most important nutritional supplement for this neonate?",
        options : [
            'Vitamin D',
            'Iron',
            'Vitamin k',
            'Folic acid',
        ],
         explanation: "Vitamin D is essential for calcium and phosphorus metabolism and bone mineralization. Preterm infants are at risk of vitamin D deficiency and rickets due to low maternal and fetal stores, decreased exposure to sunlight, and impaired renal function. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for all preterm infants. Iron is important for erythropoiesis and prevention of anemia, but it is not as critical as vitamin D in the immediate neonatal period. Vitamin K is given to all newborns at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease, but it is not a supplement that needs to be continued. Folic acid is important for DNA synthesis and prevention of neural tube defects, but it is not a supplement that needs to be given to preterm infants. - Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 21st p532"
