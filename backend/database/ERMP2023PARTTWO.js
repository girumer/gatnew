        question : "A 4-year-old child is brought to the ED by his parents with a history of hoarseness of voice and muffled sounds for the past day. They report that he has had a high fever and has been very irritable. On examination, the child is sitting upright and leaning forward, drooling, and appears to be in distress. His RR is increased, and he has stridor. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        options : [
            'Croup',
            'Bacterial tracheitis',
            'Epiglottitis',
            'Laryngomalacia',
        ],
         explanation: "The child's presentation with hoarseness, muffled voice, high fever, drooling, stridor, and the tripod position strongly suggests epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is a medical emergency caused by inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis, often due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB. in unvaccinated children. The classic presentation includes high fever, drooling, sitting in a tripod position, stridor, and a muffled voice (often referred to as a 'hot potato' voice). The child appears very ill and in significant respiratory distress. It requires immediate attention and airway management, as it can rapidly progress to life-threatening airway obstruction. The diagnosis is clinical, and visualization of the cherry-red, swollen epiglottis can confirm it, often requiring anesthetic support. Immediate intervention includes securing the airway and administering antibiotics. Croup is characterized by a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and often mild fever. It typically affects younger children and presents with a steeple sign on an X-ray of the neck. However, it does not usually cause drooling or a muffled voice. Bacterial tracheitis presents similarly to croup but usually occurs in older children and is often preceded by a viral upper respiratory infection. It can cause high fever and toxic appearance, but drooling is not a typical feature. Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of chronic stridor in infants and is due to a congenital softening of the laryngeal tissues. It typically presents in the first few weeks of life with stridor that worsens with feeding or lying down, but it does not cause acute distress, high fever, or drooling. - Nelson 21st p3787, p3790 & p3793, UpToDate"

            'Intubation',
            'Tracheostomy',
        ],
         explanation: "Epiglottitis is a medical emergency and warrants immediate treatment with an artificial airway placed under controlled conditions, either in an operating room or intensive care unit. Bag and mask ventilation is the immediate next step when a child stops breathing. It provides positive pressure ventilation, ensuring that the lungs are ventilated until further definitive airway management can be established. Then artificial airways should be applied (Intubation). Intubation is a definitive airway management technique and is necessary for long-term ventilation support. However, in the acute setting where the child has just stopped breathing, bag and mask ventilation is the immediate step to stabilize the patient before intubation. Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure to create an airway directly in the trachea. It is not an immediate first step in acute respiratory failure due to the time and surgical expertise required. It is considered in cases where intubation is not possible or in long-term airway management scenarios. - Nelson 21st p3789."

         explanation: "The child's presentation with a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and subglottic narrowing on an X-ray is most consistent with croup, and the radiographic sign associated with this condition is the steeple sign. The steeple sign is seen on an AP neck X-ray and is characteristic of croup. It results from subglottic narrowing of the trachea, which appears as a tapering or 'steeple' shape. Croup typically presents with a barking cough, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and respiratory distress, matching the symptoms in this case. Thumb sign thumb sign is seen on a lateral neck X-ray and is characteristic of epiglottitis, which is caused by inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis. Epiglottitis presents with high fever, severe sore throat, dysphagia, drooling, and the patient often appears toxic and prefers to sit leaning forward. This presentation does not match the symptoms described in the case. The bat wing sign is typically seen on a chest X-ray and is associated with pulmonary edema. It shows bilateral perihilar infiltrates that resemble a bat's wings. Snowman sign is associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), a congenital heart defect.

         explanation: "The child presents with a brassy cough, inspiratory stridor, and high fever following an upper respiratory infection. These features are characteristic of bacterial tracheitis, a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention to prevent airway obstruction. Bacterial tracheitis often follows a viral upper respiratory infection. The condition can rapidly progress to airway obstruction. The lack of drooling and the ill appearance with a high fever point towards bacterial tracheitis. Foreign body aspiration can cause sudden onset of cough, stridor, and respiratory distress, but the presence of fever and the history of a recent upper respiratory infection make bacterial tracheitis more likely. - Nelson 21st p3790, UpToDate"

        ],
         explanation: "The primigravid woman is progressing well through active labor with strong contractions and reassuring fetal heart status. The occiput transverse position can often resolve spontaneously as labor progresses, and immediate interventions like cesarean section, oxytocin infusion, or manual rotation are not necessary at this point. The best approach is to admit her to the labor and delivery unit and continue to monitor her and the fetus's status closely. Unless there is a pelvic architectural abnormality, asynclitism or hypotonic contractions, the head usually rotates spontaneously to an OA position. If rotation ceases because of poor expulsive forces, vaginal delivery can be aided i.e. by manual rotation of the occiput or by Kielland forceps also can rotate the occiput anteriorly. Manual or instrumental rotation into OA position can be considered later if labor stalls or if there are signs of fetal distress, it is not indicated at this point since the patient is progressing well with reassuring fetal status. Either standard forceps or specialized forceps, such as Kielland forceps, are used. - William's ObGyn 26th p1254, p1364-1365, Current 11th p641."

        ],
         explanation: "There are two major prevention ways for cervical cancer. HPV vaccination and screening for CIN and cervical cancer. HPV Vaccine is the most effective primary prevention method for cervical cancer. It protects against the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that are responsible for the majority of cervical cancer cases. Vaccination is recommended for girls and boys starting at ages 11-12, but it can be given as early as age 9 and up to age 26 (and sometimes beyond). Two HPV vaccines are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) against HPV-16,-18,-6, and-11 and a bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) against HPV-16 and-18. In clinical trials, the efficacy of these vaccines for preventing CIN II or worse due to HPV types included in the vaccine was 93-100% in the HPV-naïve study population. Regular Pap smears are a secondary prevention method, aimed at detecting precancerous changes and early-stage cervical cancer, rather than preventing the initial infection. While important, Pap smears do not prevent HPV infection or the development of cervical cancer from an early stage. - Current 11th p1471, William's 3rd p657 & p357."

         explanation: "The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with bacterial vaginosis, confirmed by the presence of clue cells on wet mount preparation. Clue cells (epithelial cells covered from edge to edge by short coccobacilli-type bacteriA. are the most reliable indicators of BV and were originally described by Gardner and Dukes (1955). The positive predictive value of this test or BV is 95%. The most appropriate management is oral metronidazole, which is effective against the anaerobic bacteria responsible for bacterial vaginosis. Metronidazole (Flagyl) 500mg Po BID for & days is an antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria and is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis. The presence of clue cells on wet mount is diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis, and metronidazole is the recommended treatment. Alternatives are Tinidazole and Clindamycin. Fluconazole, Clotrimazole is an antifungal medication used primarily to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infection). It is not effective against bacterial vaginosis, which is indicated by the presence of clue cells. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including some STIs, but it is not the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis. - William's 3rd p78-79, Current 11th p1168-1169."

Condyloma acuminata are caused by HPV and are sexually transmitted. The other options do not match the clinical presentation described. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is condyloma acuminata. Condyloma lata are smooth, moist, flat, and velvety lesions associated with secondary syphilis. They usually appear in moist areas such as the genitals and perineum. Cauliflower-like is not characteristic of condyloma lata. Genital herpes typically presents with painful vesicles or ulcers rather than cauliflower-like nodules. Molluscum contagiosum presents as small, flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules with a central umbilication. - Current 11th p1150, William's 3rd p97."

The mother is exhausted and has been pushing for a prolonged period, making an assisted delivery necessary. Other indications to use vacuum delivery are: (1) non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, (2) shortening of the second stage of labor for maternal reasons, and (3) prolonged second stage of labor.

            'Neonatal meningitis',
            'Epilepsy',
        ],
         explanation: "The combination of home delivery, lack of maternal immunization, poor umbilical cord care, and classic symptoms of muscle spasms and rigidity strongly suggest neonatal tetanus. The infantile form of generalized tetanus, typically manifests within 3-12 days of birth. It presents as progressive difficulty in feeding (sucking and swallowing), associated hunger, and crying. Paralysis or diminished movement, stiffness and rigidity to the touch, and spasms, with or without opisthotonos, are characteristic. The umbilical stump, which is typically the portal of entry for the microorganism, may retain remnants of dirt, dung, clotted blood, or serum, or it may appear relatively benign. Neonatal tetanus typically occurs in infants born to mothers who have not been adequately immunized with tetanus toxoid. It is often associated with unclean delivery practices and poor umbilical cord care. The red and swollen umbilical stump supports the diagnosis. Hypocalcemia can cause neonatal seizures and spasms, but it is less likely to present with the severe rigidity and classic opisthotonos seen in tetanus. Additionally, hypocalcemia is often associated with other symptoms such as jitteriness and feeding difficulties. Meningitis can present with irritability, poor feeding, and seizures in a newborn, but it typically does not cause the characteristic muscle rigidity and spasms triggered by stimuli seen in tetanus. Additionally, there would usually be other signs of systemic infection, such as fever and a bulging fontanelle. - Nelson 21st p2531, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Congenital hypothyroidism often presents with prolonged jaundice, poor feeding, lethargy, and characteristic facial features such as a protruding tongue, puffy face, and large fontanelles. These signs are due to the lack of thyroid hormone, which is crucial for metabolism and development. Neonatal jaundice typically resolves within the first two weeks of life. The additional symptoms of poor feeding, protruding tongue, lethargy, and other physical signs indicate a more specific underlying condition. Galactosemia can present with jaundice and poor feeding, but it is typically associated with symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive soon after the introduction of milk.

It commonly presents with central facial redness, papules, and pustules, and it is often exacerbated by triggers such as spicy foods, hot beverages, alcohol, and sunlight. The chronic erythema and flushing, along with the patient's triggers, are characteristic of rosacea. Rosacea may be mistaken for inflammatory acne. Rosacea usually occurs in an older age group of patients (30-50yrs), and lacks comedones or scarring and doesn't affect the trunk. Acne vulgaris typically presents with comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and possibly nodules or cysts, primarily affecting the face, chest, and back. Some patients have features of both diseases and clinical acne may evolve into more typical rosacea later in life. Seborrheic dermatitis often presents with flaky, greasy scales and redness, primarily affecting the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and behind the ears. It does not typically cause the flushing or the papules and pustules seen in this case.

Clinical features include bone pain, skeletal deformities (such as bow legs or knock knees), enlargement of costochondral junctions (rachitic rosary), and metaphyseal changes seen on X-ray. Rachitic changes are most easily visualized on posteroanterior radiographs of the wrist. The edge of the metaphysis loses its sharp border, which is described as fraying. The edge of the metaphysis changes from a convex or flat surface to a more concave surface. This change to a concave surface is termed cupping and is most easily seen at the distal ends of the radius, ulna, and fibula. Other radiologic features include coarse trabeculation of the diaphysis and generalized rarefaction. Osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone, which typically presents with localized pain, swelling, and erythema over the affected bone. It does not cause the characteristic metaphyseal changes seen in rickets.

        explanation: "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections on the face can lead to several complications, but the most feared one, particularly for patients with recurrent facial herpes, is corneal scarring. Herpetic keratitis can result in permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. Managing HSV infections with antiviral therapy and monitoring for ocular involvement are critical to preventing this serious complication. Recurrent HSV infections affecting the eyes are particularly concerning because of the potential for keratitis and subsequent corneal scarring, which can result in permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. Post-herpetic neuralgia is a complication primarily associated with herpes zoster (shingles), not with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Permanent facial scarring can occur with recurrent herpes simplex infections, especially if lesions are severe or secondary bacterial infections develop, it is generally less feared compared to corneal involvement. - Harrison's 21st p5549, Rook's Dermatology 9thp3004"

This approach provides immediate relief from distressing symptoms while accurately diagnosing the underlying condition, typically Graves' disease. Thyroid function tests (TSH, Free T4, and T3) are essential to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Antithyroid medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil need to be started after confirmation of the diagnosis through TFT. Thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy are more appropriate for evaluating thyroid nodules or suspected thyroid cancer.

        explanation: "Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic, superficial, inflammatory process affecting the hairy regions of the body, especially the scalp, eyebrows, and face. Its cause is thought to be an inflammatory reaction to the Malassezia yeast (formerly Pityrosporum ovale). It's characterized by erythematous, flaky lesions that typically occur in areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face (particularly the nasal folds), behind the ears, and in the axillae.

            'Do not give anti-D unless the baby is confirmed to be Rh positive at birth',
        ],
        explanation: "In an Rh-negative pregnant woman, prophylactic administration of anti-D immunoglobulin is essential at 28 weeks of gestation to prevent sensitization. After delivery, if the baby is Rh positive, another dose should be administered within 72 hours to further prevent Rh sensitization. Recognizing that 40% of neonates born to D-negative women are also D negative, administration of immune globulin is recommended only after the newborn is confirmed to be D positive. Fetomaternal hemorrhage at delivery accounts for as many as 90% of alloimmunization cases. Routine postpartum administration of anti-D to at-risk pregnancies within 72 hours of delivery lowers the alloimmunization rate by 90%. Additionally, provision of anti-D at 28 weeks' gestation reduces the third-trimester alloimmunization rate from approximately 2%- 0.1%. The standard IM dose of anti-D 300 µg or 1500 IU will protect the average-sized mother from a fetal hemorrhage of up to 30mL of fetal whole blood or 15mL of fetal red cells. - William's ObGyn 26th p892, Current 11th p505, Gabbe's p776-779, ACOG 2019b"

The cervix being closed and the absence of bleeding or tissue passage further support this diagnosis. A missed abortion is when the fetus has died but has not been expelled from the uterus. The closed cervix and lack of tissue passage support this diagnosis. Inevitable abortion is characterized by the presence of an open cervix and often the passage of amniotic fluid or bleeding, indicating that abortion is unavoidable. In this case, the cervix is closed, which is not consistent with inevitable abortion. Threatened abortion involves vaginal bleeding and a closed cervix but with an ongoing pregnancy.

        explanation: "Given the infectious nature of MDR-TB and the patient's refusal to comply with infection control measures, it is essential to admit and isolate him to prevent the spread of the disease. This step ensures the safety of other patients, hospital staff, and the public. Respecting his wishes and allow him to interact with others is not appropriate as it poses a significant public health risk. MDR-TB is highly infectious, and allowing the patient to interact with others without proper precautions could lead to the spread of the disease. Counseling is important, hoping and relying on the patient's voluntary compliance, which he has already refused, does not adequately address the immediate public health risk.

While BDD could explain the preoccupation with body odor, the patient's belief that others are lying and the conviction about the smell are more suggestive of a delusion rather than the obsessive focus seen in BDD. - UpToDate"

        explanation: "Drug hypersensitivity reactions can present with various skin manifestations, including maculopapular rashes and pustules, especially after a patient has been on a medication like phenytoin for several weeks to months. This reaction is often associated with systemic symptoms like fever and malaise. Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe, rapidly progressing infection of the fascia that can cause extensive tissue necrosis. It usually presents with severe pain, swelling, and systemic toxicity. The presence of a maculopapular rash and pustules without significant pain or rapid progression makes this diagnosis less likely. TEN is a severe, life-threatening skin condition characterized by widespread necrosis and detachment of the epidermis. It often presents with extensive blistering and involves mucous membranes. The absence of these features in this patient makes TEN less likely. SJS is a severe mucocutaneous reaction, usually to medications, characterized by widespread skin and mucosal involvement, with blistering and necrosis affecting less than 10% of the body surface area. The patient's lack of mucosal involvement and extensive blistering suggests a less severe reaction than SJS. - UpToDate"

Additionally, they report that he has a soft, palpable mass in his abdomen. He has been increasingly irritable and appears to have lost weight recently.

            'Neuroblastoma',
        ],
        explanation: "In a child presenting with both proptosis and an abdominal mass, neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis. This tumor arises from neural crest cells and can metastasize to the orbit, causing eye protrusion, and is frequently found in the adrenal gland or along the sympathetic chain in the abdomen. Further diagnostic work-up, including imaging and biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment. Given the presentation of a childhood tumor with an abdominal mass that crosses the midline, periorbital ecchymosis, bone pain, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and anemia, neuroblastoma is the most likely diagnosis. This cancer often metastasizes to the bone marrow and orbits, leading to the characteristic signs and symptoms described. Retinoblastoma typically presents with leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) and can cause proptosis if it extends beyond the orbit, but it does not usually present with an abdominal mass. Wilms tumor is a common pediatric renal tumor that presents with an abdominal mass. It is typically non-tender and firm but does not usually cause proptosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma can present with a mass in various locations, including the orbit (leading to proptosis) and the abdomen. However, it is less likely to present simultaneously in both areas as compared to neuroblastoma. - Nelson 21st p4754, UpToDate"

        ],
        explanation: "The sudden onset of painless vaginal bleeding during labor, followed by a rapid drop and then absence of the fetal HR, is highly suggestive of vasa previa. This condition leads to rupture of fetal vessels and rapid fetal blood loss, causing immediate and severe fetal distress and demise. Vasa previa occurs when fetal blood vessels cross or run near the internal os of the uterus, unprotected by the placenta or umbilical cord. Rupture of these vessels during labor can cause sudden vaginal bleeding and rapid fetal HR deceleration, leading to fetal exsanguination and death. The scenario described fits vasa previa, especially with the sudden onset of bleeding and immediate fetal HR drop followed by absence. Uterine rupture is characterized by sudden onset of pain, loss of fetal station, and abnormal uterine contour, often accompanied by vaginal bleeding and signs of fetal distress. Cord prolapse presents with sudden fetal HR deceleration and can occur with or without vaginal bleeding. The primary feature is palpation of the cord during the pelvic examination. - William's ObGyn 26th p291-293, Current 11th p601"

        ],
        explanation: "This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of chronic alcohol use, which is a significant risk factor for acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas that is characterized by edema and, when severe, necrosis. It is a common and challenging disease that can develop local and systemic complications. As such, it ranges from a mild, self-limiting inflammation of the pancreas to severe and critical disease characterized by infected pancreatic necrosis, multiple organ failure, and a high mortality. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires the patient to present with abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a severe constant epigastric pain that often radiates through to the mid back) and the elevation of serum amylase or lipase (>3 times upper limit of normal). Imaging (usually by contrast-CT) is only required for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis when these diagnostic criteria are not met. Perforated PUD can cause raised serum amylase but presents with severe abdominal pain, it typically involves sudden onset of sharp pain and may be associated with signs of peritonitis such as rebound tenderness and a rigid abdomen. Cholecystitis usually presents with right upper quadrant pain, which may radiate to the right shoulder or back, and is often associated with fever and a positive Murphy's sign (pain on palpation of the right upper quadrant during inspiration). The epigastric pain radiating to the back and elevated pancreatic enzymes make this diagnosis less likely. - Schwartz's 11th p1471, Bailey 25th p1132"

The description of a \"three tumor abdomen\" suggests the presence of multiple large uterine fibroids or another obstructing condition causing the obstruction, consistent with the clinical picture. CPD occurs when the fetal head is too large to pass through the maternal pelvis.

        ],
        explanation: "Atropine is the treatment of choice for organophosphate poisoning. It is an anticholinergic agent that counteracts the muscarinic effects of organophosphates by blocking acetylcholine receptors. This helps reduce symptoms such as bradycardia, bronchorrhea, and bronchospasm. The dosage is titrated to effect, and large doses may be required. Gastric lavage is generally not recommended for organophosphate poisoning, especially after 8 hours of ingestion due to the risk of aspiration and the limited benefit this late after exposure. Gastric lavage is typically only considered within the first hour after ingestion. Activated charcoal can be used to prevent the absorption of organophosphates if administered shortly after ingestion. However, its efficacy decreases significantly after several hours. Given that the patient presented 8 hours after exposure, activated charcoal would be of limited benefit in this scenario. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) is used to reactivate acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphates, thus addressing the nicotinic effects (such as muscle weakness and paralysis). It is an important part of the treatment but should be used in conjunction with atropine. In this scenario, atropine administration is the priority to stabilize the patient. - Tintinalli's 9th p1301-1302"

        explanation: "Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is the most common primary malignant renal tumor of childhood. It is the second most common malignant abdominal tumor in childhood after neuroblastoma. It is thought to be derived from incompletely differentiated renal mesenchyme, and tumors are typically composed of cells reminiscent of the undifferentiated and partially differentiated cells that normally arise from renal mesenchyme. The most common initial clinical presentation for Wilms tumor is the incidental discovery of an asymptomatic abdominal mass by parents while bathing or clothing an affected child or by a physician during a routine physical examination. Hypertension is present in about 25% of patients at presentation and has been attributed to increased renin activity. Abdominal pain (40%), gross painless hematuria (18%), and constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, and weight loss are other findings at diagnosis. Polycystic kidney disease can cause the kidneys to enlarge and form palpable masses due to multiple cysts. However, it is usually bilateral and presents with other symptoms such as hypertension and, in severe cases, renal insufficiency.

        explanation: "Myasthenia Gravis is characterized by muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest/sleep, often affecting the ocular, bulbar, and limb muscles. The progressive nature of the weakness and its fluctuation throughout the day, as well as the involvement of both upper and lower extremities without sensory changes, are typical of this condition. The patient's symptoms becoming worse in the afternoon also aligns with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. Myopathies are disorders that primarily affect the muscles themselves, leading to muscle weakness. They typically present with symmetric weakness, often involving the proximal muscles first. While myopathies can cause progressive weakness, they are less likely to show the diurnal variation seen in this patient, where symptoms worsen throughout the day and improve with rest. GBS is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy that typically presents with ascending weakness, often following an infection. It is characterized by rapid progression of weakness, areflexia, and sometimes sensory changes. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and fasciculations.

Aspirin helps with the joint inflammation, fever, and pain, while prednisolone effectively reduces myocardial inflammation and improves cardiac function. This combination is essential in severe cases with carditis and heart failure. The usual dose of aspirin is 50-70 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses PO for 3-5 days, followed by 50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses PO for 2-3wk and half that dose for another 2-4wk. The usual dose of prednisone is 2 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 2-3wk, followed by half the dose for 2-3wk and then tapering of the dose by 5 mg/24 hr every 2-3 days.

Symptoms of CO poisoning include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and altered mental status, which can progress to loss of consciousness. Both the child and the mother presenting with similar symptoms after using charcoal indoors strongly suggest CO poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues, which can lead to hypoxia and the symptoms observed. Organophosphate poisoning occurs from exposure to insecticides or nerve agents and presents with symptoms related to cholinergic excess, such as salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis (SLUDGE syndrome), along with muscle twitching and miosis (constricted pupils). Lead poisoning typically presents with symptoms related to neurologic dysfunction (e.g., irritability, developmental delay in children, abdominal pain) and can occur through various environmental exposures, not directly related to cooking with charcoal.

Moderate ketonuria, if present, is secondary to starvation. Lab findings in HHS includes ketones +/-, bicarbonate >18meq/L, arterial pH >7.3, moderately increased creatinine and normal or slightly low serum sodium (despite the marked hyperglycemia). Acidosis (Low Ph+), specifically metabolic acidosis with an anion gap, is a hallmark of DKA. Low bicarbonate levels are indeed seen in DKA due to metabolic acidosis. However, it is a secondary result of the acidosis. Although hyperglycemia can cause dehydration and potentially lead to renal impairment, severe renal impairment is not as immediately indicative of DKA supporting clinical findings. - UpToDate, Harrison's 21st p11343-11353"

        ],
        explanation: "Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), also known as erythroblastosis fetalis, is caused by the transplacental passage of maternal antibodies directed against paternally derived RBC antigens, which causes increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) in the infant. HDFN is an important cause of anemia and jaundice in newborn infants, and early recognition and diagnosis are crucial for proper management. HDFN occurs when there is an incompatibility between the Rh blood types of the mother and the baby. The mother's immune system produces antibodies against the Rh-positive red blood cells of the baby, leading to hemolysis. This results in anemia, jaundice, and elevated bilirubin levels in the newborn, which matches the clinical presentation in this case. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) occurs in newborns who were exposed to addictive opiate drugs while in the womb. It presents with symptoms of withdrawal such as tremors, irritability, poor feeding, and high-pitched crying, which are not related to Rh incompatibility. - Nelson 21st p1524-1526, UpToDate"

        ],
        explanation: "Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury occurs in less than 5% of patients. Of those with injury, approximately 10% are permanent. Dissection near the inferior thyroid artery is a common area for RLN injury. The right RLN is at risk during right-sided thyroid surgery. Injury to this nerve can result in hoarseness of voice due to paralysis of the right vocal cord. The persistence of symptoms three months postoperatively suggests a possible permanent injury to this nerve. Superior laryngeal nerve injury is less debilitating, as the common symptom is loss of projection of the voice. The glottic aperture is asymmetrical on direct laryngoscopy, and management is limited to clinical observation. Injury to the right SLN could cause some voice changes, particularly affecting the pitch and projection of the voice, but it is less likely to cause the persistent hoarseness described. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is more commonly associated with the described symptoms. The left RLN and left SLN are not likely to be injured during a right-sided thyroid lobectomy. - Schwartz's 11th p446, Bailey 25th p803"

        ],
        explanation: "Intussusception occurs when a portion of the alimentary tract is telescoped into an adjacent segment. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction between 5mo and 3yr of age and the most common abdominal emergency in children younger than 2yr of age. In typical cases, there is sudden onset, in a previously well child, of severe paroxysmal colicky pain that recurs at frequent intervals and is accompanied by straining efforts with legs and knees flexed and loud cries. The classic triad of pain, a palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and bloody or currant jelly stool is seen in <30% of patients with intussusception. When the clinical history and physical findings suggest intussusception, an ultrasound is typically performed. A plain abdominal radiograph might show a density in the area of the intussusception. Screening ultrasounds for suspected intussusception increases the yield of diagnostic or therapeutic enemas and reduces unnecessary radiation exposure in children with negative ultrasound examinations. The diagnostic findings of intussusception on ultrasound include a tubular mass in longitudinal views and a doughnut or target appearance (\"target sign\" or \"donut sign\") in transverse images. - Nelson 21st p3334-3335"

        explanation: "The definitive diagnosis of enteric fever requires the isolation of S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi from blood, bone marrow, other sterile sites, rose spots, stool, or intestinal secretions. The diagnostic sensitivity of blood culture is only~60% and is lower with low blood sample volume and among patients with prior antimicrobial use or in the first week of illness, reflecting the small number of S. Typhi organisms (i.e., <15/mL) typically present in the blood. Bone marrow culture is >80% sensitive, and, unlike that of blood culture, its yield is not reduced by up to 5 days of prior antibiotic therapy. Culture of intestinal secretions (best obtained by a noninvasive duodenal string test) can be positive despite a negative bone marrow culture. If blood, bone marrow, and intestinal secretions are all cultured, the yield is >90%. Stool cultures, although negative in 60-70% of cases during the first week, can become positive during the third week of infection in untreated patients. Bone marrow culture is considered the most sensitive diagnostic test for typhoid fever. It has the highest yield for detecting Salmonella Typhi, even in patients who have started antibiotic therapy. Bone marrow culture can remain positive even when other cultures are negative. - Harrison's 21st p4859-4860, STG p519, UpToDate"

It is characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and chills, often in individuals living in poor, overcrowded, and unsanitary conditions. Epistaxis, petechiae, and ecchymoses are common during louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF). The patient's presentation and living conditions are highly suggestive of LBRF, which is common in such environments. The preferred dx modality is direct detection of the spirochetes by microscopy of the blood (Giemsa or wright stain). Penicillin and tetracyclines have been the antibiotics of choice for relapsing fever for several decades. Erythromycin and chloramphenicol have been long-standing alternative choices. Close monitoring for at least 24 h and with provision of parenteral cardiovascular and volume support as needed due to the fatal JHR.

        explanation: "The most likely cause of the patient's worsening confusion and muscle twitching is the rapid correction of hyponatremia. Correcting sodium levels too quickly can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), a serious condition characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and muscle twitching. Osmotic demyelination syndrome is caused by rapid correction of hyponatremia (>12 mEq/L/24 h) as water moves from cells to ECF yielding intracellular dehydration. Raising serum sodium by 5 mEq/L is typically all that is required to see an improvement in severe neurologic symptoms. When symptoms are mild or moderate (nausea, confusion, headache) or in chronic hyponatremia, the [Na+] correction should be slower than for acute hyponatremia. The recommended rate of correction for chronic hyponatremia is generally no more than 8-10 meq/L per 24 hours to avoid this complication. - Tintinalli's 9th p85, Harrison's 21st p8361-8361"

It occurs when the uterine muscles fail to contract effectively after delivery, leading to excessive bleeding. The physical examination finding of a \"boggy\" uterus strongly suggests uterine atony as the primary cause of the bleeding. Uterine rupture is a serious obstetric emergency that typically presents with sudden onset abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and fetal distress. Retained placental fragments can also cause postpartum hemorrhage, but they typically present with persistent bleeding despite a well-contracted uterus.

        explanation: "Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) is the preferred management for patients with a Grade 4/5 splenic injury who are hemodynamically unstable despite resuscitative efforts. The risk of continued bleeding and the potential for life-threatening hemorrhage necessitate definitive surgical intervention. Splenectomy provides the most rapid control of hemorrhage in this scenario. Splenorraphy (repair of the spleen) might be considered in selected cases of lower-grade splenic injuries where preservation of the spleen is feasible, and the patient is hemodynamically stable. For Grade 5 injuries with ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability, splenorraphy is not typically sufficient or appropriate. Angioembolization can be a viable option for controlling splenic bleeding in hemodynamically stable patients or those with lower-grade splenic injuries. - Schwartz's 11th p1550 (Table 34-1c), Bailey 25th p1108"

        explanation: "Hirschsprung disease is a condition caused by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to a functional obstruction. It is characterized by delayed passage of meconium (typically beyond the first 48 hours of life), abdominal distension, and constipation. A digital rectal examination often reveals a tight anus with an empty rectal vault, followed by an explosive release of stool and gas. The history and physical findings in this case are consistent with Hirschsprung disease. In neonates, Hirschsprung disease must be differentiated from meconium plug syndrome, meconium ileus, and intestinal atresia. In older patients, the Currarino triad must be considered, which includes anorectal malformations, sacral bone anomalies and presacral anomaly. Rectal stenosis is a narrowing of the rectum, which can lead to difficulty in passing stools. However, it usually presents later in infancy or childhood with symptoms of constipation and straining rather than immediate neonatal obstruction and failure to pass meconium. Meconium ileus, or impaction of inspissated meconium in the distal small bowel, accounts for up to 30% of cases of neonatal intestinal obstruction. It's typically associated with cystic fibrosis and presents with intestinal obstruction due to thick, sticky meconium. It usually leads to abdominal distension and bilious vomiting soon after birth. - Nelson 21st p3324-3325, p1495"

        explanation: "The patient presents with symptoms characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), including intrusive, distressing thoughts and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing the anxiety caused by these thoughts. MRI studies of patients with OCD often reveal structural abnormalities in the basal ganglia, particularly a smaller caudate nucleus, which is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of OCD. This structural change is associated with the disruption of normal inhibitory circuits in the brain, contributing to the compulsive behaviors seen in OCD. Hippocampal atrophy is typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, where memory and cognitive functions are primarily affected. The orbitofrontal cortex is implicated in OCD, but the enlargement of the orb frontal cortex is not a typical finding. In OCD, there may be hyperactivity in the orbitofrontal cortex rather than structural enlargement. Enlarged ventricles are more commonly associated with conditions such as hydrocephalus, schizophrenia, or other neurodegenerative diseases. - Harrison's 21st p12866, UpToDate"

Itraconazole is the first-line treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, which is suggested by the patient's presentation and imaging findings of a cavitary lesion with a fungal ball (aspergilloma). Voriconazole is currently the preferred oral agent for chronic aspergillosis with itraconazole or posaconazole as substitutes when failure, emergence of resistance, or adverse events occur. Voriconazole is considered the first-line treatment for aspergilloma due to its superior efficacy and better penetration into the lungs.

On physical examination, the toe is tender, erythematous, and edematous. He reports no history of trauma or fever. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            'Osteoarthritis',
            'Septic Arthritis',
        ],
        explanation: "Gout typically presents with acute onset of severe pain, redness, and swelling in a single joint, most commonly the big toe (known as podagrA. in 70-90% of the cases, followed by tarsal joints, ankles, and knees. Finger, wrist, and elbow joints can also be involved, although more often in elderly patients or in advanced disease. The gout flares often begin at night to early morning, constituting one of the most painful conditions experienced by humans. The affected joints rapidly become warm, red, tender, and substantially swollen with a clinical appearance that often mimics that of cellulitis (pseudocellulitis). Typical flares tend to subside spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, and most patients have intervals of varying length with no residual symptoms until the next episode (intercritical gout). The rapid onset of symptoms and the absence of trauma are characteristic of an acute gout attack. Rheumatoid arthritis usually presents with symmetrical joint involvement and chronic, progressive symptoms rather than acute, isolated episodes of severe pain in a single joint. Osteoarthritis is characterized by chronic joint pain and stiffness, typically affecting weight-bearing joints like the knees, hips, and spine. Acute, severe pain and significant inflammation in a single joint, especially the big toe, are not typical presentations of osteoarthritis. Septic arthritis can present with acute pain, redness, and swelling in a joint, but it is often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever and chills. The rapid onset of symptoms in the absence of systemic signs makes gout more likely. Additionally, the patient's history does not suggest risk factors commonly associated with septic arthritis, such as recent joint surgery, injection, or systemic infection. - Harrison's 21st p10430-10433, UpToDate"

        explanation: "Even with sunlight exposure, it is recommended that all exclusively breastfed infants receive 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation daily after discharge from hospital to prevent rickets and ensure proper bone health. Breast milk does not contain enough vitamin D to meet the infant's needs. Iron is essential, exclusively breastfed infants typically have sufficient iron stores until about 4 to 6 months of age. After 6 months, iron supplementation or introduction of iron-rich complementary foods is recommended. At 3 months, routine iron supplementation is not typically necessary unless there are specific risk factors for iron deficiency. - Nelson 21st p541 (Table 56.5)"

        explanation: "This situation involves an emergency cesarean section due to a non-reassuring fetal heart rate, which takes priority over the planned tubal ligation. The primary focus is to perform the cesarean section promptly to address the non-reassuring fetal heart rate and prevent adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. The mother previously consented to the tubal ligation, and her autonomy is paramount. However, the high-stress environment of labor and the husband's objection suggest a potential conflict that may affect her long-term well-being. The procedure can be postponed to allow the mother to discuss the decision with her husband and reaffirm her choice in a less stressful environment."

At around 6 months of age, it is recommended to start introducing complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding. Exclusive breastfeeding beyond 6 months can lead to nutritional deficiencies such as iron deficiency, which may contribute to symptoms like irritability and decreased appetite.

        explanation: "Scarlet fever is ris caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and presents with a characteristic fine, red, sandpaper-like rash, fever, sore throat, and 'strawberry tongue', which is caused by pyrogenic exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin). The history of sore throat, high fever, and the characteristic rash and tongue appearance are consistent with scarlet fever. The rash appears within 24-48 hr after onset of symptoms, although it may appear with the first signs of illness. It often begins around the neck and spreads over the trunk and extremities. Kawasaki disease can present with fever, rash, and mucous membrane changes, including a 'strawberry tongue.' However, Kawasaki disease typically affects children under 5 years old, and the rash is often polymorphous and not as specific as the sandpaper-like rash seen in scarlet fever. Additionally, Kawasaki disease usually involves bilateral conjunctival injection, which is not described in this case. Measles is characterized by high fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, red maculopapular eruption and kolpik spots. Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and characterized by fatigue, malaise, fever, sore throat, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Maculopapular rash may be seen in 3-15% of cases.

His fixed, false belief about his body odor, which is not shared by others and leads to significant distress and functional impairment, is characteristic of this condition. Somatic symptom disorder involves excessive anxiety about physical symptoms that are present and distressing. In this case, the patient's primary concern is a perceived odor that is not detectable by others, suggesting a delusional belief rather than excessive focus on actual symptoms.

        ],
        explanation: "Insulin should be considered as part of the initial therapy in type 2 DM, particularly in lean individuals or those with severe weight loss, in individuals with underlying renal or hepatic disease that precludes oral glucose-lowering agents, or in individuals who are hospitalized or acutely ill. Some other indications to start insulin in T2DM are: Failure to control blood glucose with oral medicines, Severe kidney or liver failure, Pregnancy, Temporary use for major stress, e.g., surgery, medical illness, In patients difficult to distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes, Ketonuria, Unexplained weight loss accompanied by poorly controlled blood sugar, Initial therapy for a patient presenting with very high blood sugar o HbA1C >10% or fasting blood glucose >250 mg/dl or random glucose consistently >300 mg/d - Harrison's 21st p11335, stg p193, UpToDate"

        question : "A 45-year-old male patient presents with a severe eye injury. He opted for surgical exploration and repair. Under general anesthesia, it is discovered during exploration that the eye is unsalvageable, and enucleation is necessary. The patient had not previously consented to enucleation.",
        options : [
            'Try repair and wake him for enucleation consent',
            'Proceed with enucleation and explain later',
            'Pause the surgery and seek consent from next of kin',
            'Close the surgical site and schedule a second surgery for enucleation after obtaining consent',
        ],
        explanation: "Enucleation (removal of the eye) is a life-altering procedure that requires explicit patient consent unless there is an immediate life-threatening situation. Since the patient did not consent to enucleation beforehand, it is not appropriate to proceed without proper consent. The patient's autonomy must be respected, even if the eye is unsalvageable. Enucleation is not an emergency that must be performed during the current surgery. Seeking consent from the next of kin is not acceptable unless the patient is legally incapacitated and a proxy decision-maker has been designated, which is not the case here."

        question : "A 45-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of easy bruising and petechiae over her extremities for the past week. She denies any recent infections, medication changes, or new exposures. She has no significant past medical history. On physical examination, she has multiple petechiae and ecchymoses but no signs of active bleeding. Laboratory tests reveal a platelet count of 10,000/µl, hemoglobin of 12 g/dl, and white blood cell count within normal limits. Her peripheral blood smear shows no evidence of schistocytes.",
        options : [
            'Observation and follow-up in 1 week',
            'Platelet transfusion',
            'Intravenous immunoglobulin',
            'Oral corticosteroids',
        ],
        explanation: "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpurA. is an acquired disorder in which there is immune-mediated destruction of platelets and possibly inhibition of platelet release from the megakaryocyte. In children, it is usually an acute disease, most commonly following an infection, and with a self-limited course. In adults, it is a more chronic disease, although in some adults, spontaneous remission occurs, usually within months of diagnosis. ITP is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding and a low, often very low, platelet count, with an otherwise normal peripheral blood cells and smear. Patients usually present either with ecchymoses and petechiae or with thrombocytopenia incidentally found on a routine CBC. Initial treatment in patients without significant bleeding symptoms, severe thrombocytopenia (<5000/µL), or signs of impending bleeding (e.g., retinal hemorrhage or large oral mucosal hemorrhages) can be instituted as an outpatient using single agents. Traditionally, this has been prednisone at 1 mg/kg or a 4-day course of dexamethasone, 40 mg/d. This treatment is appropriate for patients who do not have life-threatening bleeding but have critically low platelet counts, as in this case. The patient should be started on oral corticosteroids to increase the platelet count and manage the condition effectively. Platelet transfusion is generally not the first-line treatment in ITP unless the patient is actively bleeding or requires an urgent surgical procedure. Transfused platelets are often rapidly destroyed due to the underlying autoimmune process. IVIG is an effective treatment for ITP and can be used, particularly in cases requiring rapid increase in platelet count, such as in the presence of active bleeding or when rapid preparation for surgery is needed. However, for initial management, especially in the absence of bleeding, oral corticosteroids are typically preferred due to ease of administration and cost-effectiveness. - Harrison's 21st p3443-3445"

        question : "A 30-year-old male is unconscious on admission following a road traffic accident. He was the driver of the car and there is the suspicion that he was responsible for the accident in which a passenger of another car died. In attendance with the patient is his wife who was uninjured in the accident. The police are keen to obtain a blood sample for alcohol measurement but the patient is incapable of giving consent for this procedure. What is the most appropriate action in these circumstances?",
        options : [
            'Inform the police that you may only take blood samples on medical grounds.',
            'Draw a blood sample for later analysis when the O patient is competent to consent.',
            'Draw a blood sample which can be analyzed immediately.',
            'Obtain consent from his wife, as next of kin, to draw the blood sample.',
        ],
        explanation: "Draw a blood sample for later analysis when the patient is competent to consent. Following the Police Reform Act, it is no longer necessary to obtain consent from unconscious or incapacitated drivers. However, the sample is not tested until the person regains competence and gives valid consent to it being tested. A competent person who refuses to allow his or her sample to be tested might be liable to prosecution. Similarly, the new law recognizes the duty to justice."

        options : [
            'Explain the pros and cons of the procedure in simple words to ensure the patient understands.',

            'Proceed without detailed consent, as he has implicitly trusted the medical team.',
        ],
        explanation: "Informed consent requires that the patient understands the nature of the procedure, its risks, benefits, and alternatives. Simplifying the explanation ensures that the patient can make an informed decision, even if he is uneducated. This respects the patient's autonomy and legal requirements for informed consent."

        explanation: "Delirium tremens (DT) is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that usually occurs 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by acute confusion, autonomic hyperactivity (tremors, sweating, tachycardia), and hallucinations (visual, tactile). The patient's symptoms of confusion, hallucinations (hyenas and snakes), tremors, sweating, and unstable vital signs are classic features of DT. Delirium is a clinical diagnosis that is made only at the bedside. Two subtypes have been described-hyperactive and hypoactive, based on differential psychomotor features. The cognitive syndrome associated with severe alcohol withdrawal (i.e., \"delirium tremens\") remains the classic example of the hyperactive subtype - Harrison's 21st p12925, p789, Tintinalli's 9th p1224, DSM-5 p499-500, UpToDate"
