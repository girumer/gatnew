        question : "A 25-year-old woman who is HIV positive delivers a healthy baby boy. She wants to breastfeed her baby. What is the best advice for her?",
        options : [
            'Breastfeed exclusively for the first six months and then introduce complementary foods',
            'Breastfeed only if she is on antiretroviral therapy and the baby is on prophylaxis',
            'Breastfeed only if the baby tests negative for HIV at birth and at six weeks',
            'Avoid breastfeeding and use formula or donor milk instead',
        ],
         explanation: "The four acute infections in which breastfeeding is contraindicated are (1) herpes simplex lesions of the breast; (2) acute maternal varicella in the first 3 days of the neonate's life; (3) untreated active tuberculosis; and (4) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease when it occurs in developed countries. Breastfeeding is a major route of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy, in addition to peripartum IV antiretroviral therapy, CS in selected cases, and avoidance of breastfeeding, can significantly decrease the risk of vertical transmission. In the third world, breastfeeding is still recommended for these women due to the risks associated with contaminated water for formula. The World Health Organization recommends that HIV-positive mothers avoid breastfeeding and use safe and affordable alternatives, such as formula or donor milk, if they are available. If these alternatives are not feasible, exclusive breastfeeding with antiretroviral therapy for the mother and the baby may be considered, but the risk of transmission is still present. The 2020 Ethiopian MOH ObGyn guideline recommends, for mothers who fulfill Acceptable, Feasible, Affordable, Sustainable and Safe (AFASS) feeding, formula feeding should be considered after thorough discussion with the family. And for those who do not fulfill AFASS, breastfeeding must be exclusive for six months and complementary feeding should start at 6th month. Breastfeeding should be continued until the first year of life but not more than two years. -William's Obstetrics 26th p1628, Gabbe's Obstetrics 7th p542, Current ObGyn 11th p1310, MOH guideline p197"

        question : "A 32-year-old woman who is HIV positive has a viral load of 1000 copies/mL and is in labor. She has been on antiretroviral therapy since the second trimester. What is the best mode of delivery for her?",
        options : [

            'Vaginal delivery',
            'Vacuum extraction',
            'Forceps delivery',
        ],
         explanation: "The mode of delivery for HIV-positive women depends on the viral load and the gestational age. For women with a viral load <1000 copies/mL at 36 weeks, vaginal delivery is preferred, as it has lower maternal morbidity and mortality than cesarean section. For women with a viral load >1000 copies/mL or unknown, elective cesarean section at 38 weeks is recommended to reduce the risk of transmission. In the case of early labor, cesarean delivery is preferred to vaginal birth. Instrumental delivery and induction of labor should be avoided, as they may increase the risk of fetal trauma and exposure to maternal blood. - William's Obstetrics 26th p3154, ACOG 2020C, MOH guideline 2020 p196-197"

            'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and blood transfusion',
        ],
         explanation: "The infant has hyaline membrane disease (HMD), also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), which is caused by surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity. Recognizing the benefits of surfactant replacement therapy, in addition to the potential protective effects of prophylactic nCPAP, some experts recommend intubation for prophylactic or early rescue surfactant replacement therapy, followed by extubation back to nCPAP immediately once the infant is stable (usually within minutes to <1 hr). The aforementioned method is commonly referred to as intubate surfactant and extubate (INSURE). Surfactant administration via endotracheal tube can improve lung compliance and oxygenation and reduce the risk of complications, such as pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. CPAP can be used as an alternative, prophylactic or a weaning method from mechanical ventilation, but it does not replace surfactant. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is evidence of infection. Nitric oxide, steroids, ECMO, and blood transfusion are reserved for refractory cases or complications of HMD. - Nelson 21st p1459"

        question : "A 6-week-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother, who complains that he has been vomiting after every feeding for the past two weeks. The vomiting is projectile and non-bilious. She also notices that he has lost weight and is dehydrated. On physical examination, the doctor palpates an olive-shaped mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. What is the best imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis?",

        ],
         explanation: "The boy has hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), which is a narrowing of the pyloric canal due to hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle. The diagnosis has traditionally been established by palpating the pyloric mass. The mass is firm, movable, approximately 2 cm in length, olive shaped, hard, best palpated from the left side, and located above and to the right of the umbilicus in the mid epigastrium beneath the liver's edge. The best imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis is ultrasound. Criteria for diagnosis include pyloric thickness 3-4 mm, an overall pyloric length 15-19 mm, and pyloric diameter of 10-14 mm (Fig. 355.2). Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of approximately 95%. Abdominal X-ray may show gastric dilation and absence of gas in the duodenum, but it is not diagnostic. CT and MRI are not indicated for this condition, as they are more expensive and expose the infant to radiation or sedation. - Nelson 21st p3293"

        question : "A 9-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents, who report that she has been having episodes of colicky abdominal pain and bloody stools for the past three days. The pain is intermittent and lasts for a few minutes. The stools are mixed with mucus and have a 'currant jelly' appearance. On physical examination, the girl is lethargic and pale.

            'Hirschsprung disease',
        ],
         explanation: "The girl has intussusception, which is the telescoping of a segment of the intestine into another segment, causing obstruction and ischemia. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants and children. It typically presents with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stools, and a palpable mass in the abdomen. Blood is generally passed in the first 12 hr but at times not for 1-2 days and infrequently not at all; 60% of infants pass a stool containing red blood and mucus, the currant jelly stool. The classic triad of pain, a palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and bloody or currant jelly stool is seen in <30% of patients with intussusception. Intestinal atresia is a congenital malformation that causes complete obstruction of the intestine, usually in the duodenum or ileum. It presents with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium in the neonatal period. Meckel diverticulum is a remnant of the vitelline duct that may contain ectopic gastric or pancreatic tissue. It may cause painless rectal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, or inflammation, but it is usually asymptomatic. - Nelson 21st p3335"

         explanation: "Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone, most common from middle age onward. The symptoms described by the patient, such as pain, difficulty walking, reduced range of motion, crepitus, and leg-length discrepancy, are typical of osteoarthritis of the hip. Radiography feature of joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone sclerosis are pathognomonic of Osteoarthritis. Periarticular erosions and pannus formation are more characteristic of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and osteonecrosis with collapse of the femoral head would not present with the chronic symptoms described and is typically associated with a different clinical history. - Apley's 10th p101, Schwartz's 11th p1932, Bailey 25th p517"

        ],
         explanation: "The boy has a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a congenital heart defect that causes a hole in the septum between the left and right ventricles. It is the most common congenital heart defect. It causes a left-to-right shunt of blood, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure. It may present with failure to thrive, recurrent respiratory infections, dyspnea, fatigue, and cyanosis. Characteristically, a loud, harsh, or blowing holosystolic murmur is present and heard best over the lower left sternal border, and it is frequently accompanied by a thrill. The echocardiogram may show the size and location of the defect, as well as the degree of shunting and pulmonary hypertension. ASD is a congenital heart defect that causes a hole in the septum between the left and right atria. It causes a left-to-right shunt of blood, resulting in increased right atrial and ventricular volumes. It may present with dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, or paradoxical embolism. The murmur of ASD is systolic and best heard at the second left intercostal space. PDA is a congenital heart defect that causes a persistent connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. It causes a left-to-right shunt of blood, resulting in increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure. It may present with dyspnea, fatigue, poor feeding, or endocarditis. The murmur of PDA is continuous and best heard at the left infraclavicular area.TOF is a congenital heart defect that consists of four components: pulmonary stenosis, VSD, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It causes a right-to-left shunt of blood, resulting in decreased pulmonary blood flow and cyanosis. It may present with tet spells, clubbing, polycythemia, or brain abscess. The murmur of TOF is systolic and best heard at the left upper sternal border. - Nelson 21st p4151, p4191, p4155 & p4146"

HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It has more than 100 types, of which some are associated with cervical cancer (high-risk types, such as 16 and 18. and some are associated with genital warts (low-risk types, such as 6 and 11). Genital warts may present with flesh-colored, raised, cauliflower-like lesions on the external genitalia, perianal area, or cervix. The diagnosis is made by clinical appearance or biopsy, which may show koilocytes (cells with perinuclear vacuolization and irregular nuclei). Syphilis philis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacterium. It has three stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary syphilis may present with a painless chancre (ulcer) on the genitalia, anus, or mouth. The diagnosis is made by dark-field microscopy or serology. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a sexually transmitted infection that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It has two types: HSV-1, which usually causes oral lesions, and HSV-2, which usually causes genital lesions. Genital herpes may present with painful vesicles or ulcers on the external genitalia, perianal area, or cervix. The diagnosis is made by viral culture, PCR, or serology. Haemophilus ducreyi (H. ducreyi) is a gram-negative coccobacillus that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection. It may present with painful ulcers and inguinal lymphadenitis on the genitalia. The diagnosis is made by culture or PCR. - Current ObGyn 11th p1150 & p1278, William's Gynecology 3rd p97 & p84 "

It typically presents with a painless chancre (ulcer) on the genitalia, anus, or mouth, and may be associated with regional lymphadenopathy. A reactive non treponemal (VDRL/RPR) screening test must be confirmed by a treponemal test to rule out a biological false-positive reaction. The next best step in the management of this patient is to perform a treponemal test, which is more specific and sensitive than a non-treponemal test, and can confirm the diagnosis of syphilis. A non-treponemal test may be false positive in some conditions, such as pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, or viral infections. A treponemal test may also be used to monitor the response to treatment, as it becomes negative after successful therapy. - Harrison's 21st p5311-5312 & p4105, UpToDate",

It causes an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, resulting in skin damage, pigmentation changes, and increased risk of skin cancers. It typically presents with sunburn, freckles, telangiectasias, atrophy, and skin tumors in sun-exposed areas. The diagnosis is made by clinical history, physical examination, and skin biopsy, which may show a marked decrease in melanocytes and keratinocytes, and an increase in fibroblasts and collagen. Vitiligo is a condition that causes depigmentation of the skin, due to autoimmune destruction of melanocytes. It typically presents with well-defined, white patches on the skin, which may be symmetric or asymmetric. Melasma is a condition that causes hyperpigmentation of the skin, due to increased melanin production. It typically presents with brown or gray patches on the face, especially on the forehead, cheeks, nose, and upper lip.

It typically affects the face, chest, and back, and may present with various types of lesions, such as comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, or scars. The clinical hallmark of acne vulgaris is the comedone, which may be closed (whitehead) or open (blackhead). Closed comedones appear as 1-to 2-mm pebbly white papules, which are accentuated when the skin is stretched. They are the precursors of inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris. The contents of closed comedones are not easily expressed. Open comedones, which rarely result in inflammatory acne lesions, have a dilated follicular orifice and are filled with easily expressible oxidized, darkened, oily debris. Comedones are usually accompanied by inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, or nodules. Papules are small, solid, raised lesions that may be red or inflamed. Pustules are small, pus-filled lesions that may be yellow or white. Nodules are large, deep, firm lesions that may be painful or tender. Cysts are large, fluid-filled lesions that may be soft or fluctuant. Scars are permanent marks that result from tissue damage or healing.

The SAFE strategy for trachoma management supported by the WHO and other agencies encompasses Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics for active disease, Facial hygiene and Environmental improvement. Mass antibiotic distribution is a treatment strategy for trachoma, which involves giving oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline to affected individuals and their contacts. It can reduce the bacterial load and the severity of the disease, but it does not prevent the recurrence or the complications. Insecticide-treated bed nets are a prevention strategy for malaria, which is a parasitic infection caused by Plasmodium species. - Kanski's clinical ophthalmology 8th p140, The Wills Eye Manual 6th 117, UpToDate"

It may present with sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, neck stiffness, and photophobia. For hemorrhagic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage are two important causes. The most appropriate action for this patient is to refer to a neurosurgeon, who can perform an angiography and a surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of the aneurysm. Early aneurysm repair prevents rerupture and allows the safe application of techniques to improve blood flow. Definitive repair is carried out within 24 h of the bleed in all patients who are stable enough to tolerate the procedure. An aneurysm can be 'clipped' by a neurosurgeon or 'coiled' by an endovascular surgeon. Surgical repair involves placing a metal clip across the aneurysm neck, thereby immediately eliminating the risk of rebleeding. Harrison's 21st p12200, UpToDate The risk of rebleeding is greatest in the first 2 to 12 hours and can be reduced by adequate blood pressure control. Control blood pressure with a titratable agent to balance the risk of stroke, hypertension-related rebleeding, and maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure. While target pressures have not yet been established, a decrease in systolic blood pressure to a range of 120 to 160 mm Hg is reasonable. Admit all patients diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage to an intensive care unit in consultation with a neurosurgeon. - Tintinalli's 9th p1116"

         explanation: "The supraorbital nerve is one of two branches of the frontal nerve (the other being the supratrochlear), itself a branch of the ophthalmic nerve which is a one of the three branches of trigeminal nerve. The supraorbital nerve exits the frontal bone through the supraorbital foramen and provides sensation to the superior aspects of the eye and the forehead and, extending posteriorly, provides cutaneous coverage to a large portion of the scalp. Supraorbital nerve provides sensation to the upper eyelid, forehead, and scalp. An injury to this nerve can cause numbness in these areas. Supratrochlear nerve is the second branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It provides sensation to the medial aspect of the forehead. However, it is less likely to be injured in a laceration that crosses the midline of the forehead. Zygomaticotemporal nerve is a branch of the maxillary nerve (the second branch of the trigeminal nerve) and it provides sensation to areas of the face around the zygomatic arch and temporal region. It is not likely to be affected by a forehead laceration. Auriculotemporal nerve is a branch of the mandibular nerve (the third branch of the trigeminal nerve) and it provides sensation to various regions on the side of the head, including the auricle of the ear and the skin above the temporal bone.

         explanation: "Ectodermal dysplasia is a group of genetic disorders that affect the development of ectodermal tissues, which include the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. In this case, the absence of tooth buds on the radiograph and the smooth, pale gums suggests a developmental issue rather than a nutritional deficiency or hormonal problem. Anodontia, or absence of teeth, occurs when no tooth buds form (ectodermal dysplasia, or familial missing teeth) or when there is a disturbance of a normal site of initiation. The teeth that are most commonly absent are the third molars, the maxillary lateral incisors, and the mandibular second premolars. Some other of minor developmental anomalies are: .Anodontia: ectodermal dysplasia, .Notched incisors: congenital syphilis, .Late dental eruption: Hunter syndrome, hypothyroidism, .Talon cusps: Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, .Wide-spaced teeth: Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Angelman syndrome While vitamin D and calcium deficiency can affect tooth development and eruption, they would not typically result in the complete absence of tooth buds.

It may present with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and positive pregnancy test. For most ectopic pregnancies, medical therapy is preferred, if feasible, to avoid surgical risks. Disqualifying criteria are a ruptured fallopian tube and drug contraindications. Medical therapy traditionally involves the antimetabolite methotrexate (MTX). This drug is a folic acid antagonist. It tightly binds to dihydrofolate reductase, blocking the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is the active form of folic acid. As a result, de novo purine and pyrimidine production is halted, which then arrests DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Thus, MTX is highly effective against rapidly proliferating trophoblast.

Open reduction and internal fixation may be indicated later, after the patient is stabilized and the fracture site is evaluated. Casting and crutches are not adequate for femoral fractures, as they do not provide enough stability and support. Amputation and prosthesis are only considered as a last resort, when there is severe tissue necrosis or infection. Observation and physical therapy are part of the rehabilitation process, but not the initial management. - Apley's 10th p898, UpToDate Femoral shaft fractures are generally evident in the prehospital setting because of the shortening, deformity, and associated swelling. Initiate traction in the field to minimize pain, prevent further fracture comminution, and minimize blood loss.

         explanation: "Cesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery for umbilical cord prolapse, a rare but serious obstetric complication in which the umbilical cord descends below the presenting part of the fetus. Umbilical cord prolapse can cause fetal hypoxia and distress, as the cord may be compressed by the fetal head or the uterine contractions. The diagnosis is made by the visualization or palpation of the cord in the vagina. The management of umbilical cord prolapse involves the elevation of the fetal head to relieve the cord compression, the administration of oxygen and tocolytics to the mother, and the immediate delivery of the fetus by cesarean section.

Colposcopic evaluation is warranted or all HSIL cytology regardless of age or HPV status. Alternative management of HSIL cytology in women 25 years and older includes immediate loop electrosurgical exo excision procedure (LEEP), which is re erred to as a see-and-LEEP approach. This strategy is reasonable because colposcopy may miss a high-grade lesion, and most HSIL cytologies eventually result in excision or diagnosis or treatment. Inadequate colposcopy should prompt excision unless initial biopsies show invasive cancer. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure is the most appropriate next step in management for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), a precancerous condition of the cervix caused by HPV infection. HSIL indicates a high risk of progression to cervical cancer, and requires immediate evaluation and treatment. LEEP is a minimally invasive technique that uses a thin wire loop heated by electric current to remove the abnormal cervical tissue. LEEP has the advantages of being simple, effective, and low-cost, and can provide a specimen for histological confirmation. -William's Gynecology 3rd p663, Current ObGyn 11th p1481-1482 (Fig 48-5)"

Late decelerations indicate fetal hypoxia and acidosis, and are associated with uteroplacental insufficiency, which can result from maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes, postterm pregnancy, or oxytocin use. The management of late decelerations involves the correction of the underlying cause, the optimization of maternal oxygenation and perfusion, and the delivery of the fetus if the condition persists or worsens. -William's Obstetrics 26th p1130, Current ObGyn 11th p453, UpToDate"

         explanation: "Jaw thrust is a simple maneuver that quickly improves airway patency by displacing the tongue anteriorly, relieving obstruction caused by relaxed tongue musculature. The jaw thrust is the safest method for opening the airway if there is the possibility of cervical spine injury. This maneuver helps to maintain the cervical spine in a neutral position. The rescuer, who is positioned at the head of the patient, places the hands at the sides of the victim's face, grasps the mandible at its angle, and lifts the mandible forward. This lifts the jaw and opens the airway with minimal head movement. In this scenario, where intubation may be delayed due to facial trauma, jaw thrust provides immediate airway support while minimizing further potential injury. -ATLS 10th p83, Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p145, UpToDate"

Melena is the passage of black, tarry stools, which indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Upper GI endoscopy is the diagnostic study of choice. Endoscopy allows visualization of the source of bleeding and administration of hemostatic therapy. The optimal timing relates to the severity of the bleeding. Early endoscopy (within 6-24 hours of presentation for unstable patients if adequately resuscitated and 12-36 hours for stable patients) is recommended for most patients The causes of melena include peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, esophageal varices, Mallory-Weiss tear, and malignancy. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as it allows direct visualization and biopsy of the bleeding source, and the application of hemostatic techniques, such as injection, cautery, or clipping. - Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p497, UPTODATE"

         explanation: "This is a benign condition that affects children who have a normal birth weight and length, but experience a delay in the onset and progression of puberty. The typical presentation is a child who is shorter than his or her peers, has a low growth velocity, and has a delayed bone age. The diagnosis is based on the clinical history, physical examination, and normal laboratory tests. The treatment is reassurance and observation, as most children with this condition will eventually catch up with their growth and reach their genetic potential. Growth hormone deficiency would be suspected if the boy had low levels of serum growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). However, his levels are within the normal range, making this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism can lead to growth retardation and delayed puberty. However, the boy's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels are normal, ruling out hypothyroidism. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that affects males and is associated with hypogonadism, which can cause delayed puberty and tall stature.

The typical presentation is a symmetric distribution of well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scales on the extensor surfaces, scalp, and nails. The diagnosis is usually clinical, but can be confirmed by a skin biopsy, which shows acanthosis, parakeratosis, Munro microabscesses, and dilated blood vessels. The treatment depends on the severity and extent of the disease, and may include topical agents, phototherapy, systemic agents, or biologic agents. Atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema) typically presents with pruritic, erythematous, and oozing lesions that are often located on the flexor surfaces, such as the antecubital and popliteal fossae.

Dental prophylaxis is a preventive treatment that involves cleaning the teeth to remove plaque and tartar. It's not used to treat a non-vital tooth with pulpal inflammation or infection. Tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its socket in the bone. It's typically considered if the tooth is beyond repair, but it's not the first choice for pulpal inflammation or infection. Dental crown placement involves placing a cap over a tooth. Crowns are used to protect, cover, and restore the shape of your teeth when fillings don't solve the problem.

         explanation: "The patient's symptoms of acute pain and swelling in the ankle after a twisting injury, inability to bear weight, and tenderness over the lateral malleolus are suggestive of an ankle injury. The absence of fractures on X-ray but the presence of soft tissue swelling and a subtle widening of the tibiofibular clear space further suggest a syndesmotic injury, also known as a 'high ankle sprain'. This injury involves the distal syndesmosis, which is a complex of ligaments connecting the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula. It's often caused by outward twisting of the foot, which can occur during activities like jogging. This type of injury is more severe than a typical ankle sprain and may take longer to heal. Achilles' tendonitis is characterized by pain and inflammation in the Achilles tendon, located at the back of the ankle. This condition would not typically result in a widening of the tibiofibular clear space. Plantar fasciitis causes pain in the bottom of the foot near the heel, not localized tenderness over the lateral malleolus, and would not be associated with changes in the tibiofibular clear space on an X-ray. - UpToDate"

        question : "A 55-year-old male presents with chronic low back pain that radiates into the right leg. He describes numbness and tingling along the back of his thigh and calf. Straight leg raising test is positive on the right side, reproducing his symptoms. Motor strength and reflexes are normal, and there is no saddle anesthesia. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's back and leg symptoms?",
        options : [
            'Lumbar disc herniation',
            'Spinal stenosis',
            'Sacroiliitis',
            'Sciatica',
        ],
         explanation: "The chronic low back pain, radiation into the right leg, positive straight leg raising test and absence of saddle anesthesia are indicative of lumbar disc herniation affecting the sciatic nerve. This condition occurs when the soft center of a spinal disc pushes out through a tear in the tougher outer layer, compressing nearby nerve roots and causing sciatica. The straight leg raise test is done with the patient supine. The examiner raises the patient's symptomatic leg at the hip with the knee extended and the foot dorsiflexed, being careful that the patient is not actively 'helping' in lifting the leg. Straight leg raising results in an increase in dural tension in the lower lumbar and upper sacral levels. Pain that occurs or worsens during testing or improves after testing suggests radiculopathy (positive straight leg test). This test is more sensitive but less specific for the diagnosis of radiculopathy due to disc herniation. Spinal stenosis typically presents with pain that worsens with standing and walking and is relieved by sitting or bending forward. It doesn't usually present with a positive straight leg raising test. Sacroiliitis involves inflammation of the sacroiliac joints and may cause lower back pain, but it doesn't typically cause symptoms that radiate down the leg or a positive straight leg raising test. Sciatica is a symptom rather than a diagnosis itself. It refers to pain that travels along the path of the sciatic nerve, which can be caused by a lumbar disc herniation. - UpToDate, Apley's 10th p525 & p515"

         explanation: "The patient has the right to refuse information about her medical condition or treatment, as long as she is competent and informed of the consequences of her decision. However, the surgeon should not assume that the patient's preference is fixed and irreversible. The surgeon should explore the reasons for the patient's refusal and try to address any fears or misconceptions she may have. The surgeon should also ask the patient if she would like a family member or a friend to be present during the discussion of the surgery, as this may provide emotional support and help the patient to cope with the stress. The surgeon should respect the patient's autonomy and obtain a valid consent, but also maintain a therapeutic relationship and offer to provide information if the patient changes her mind.

         explanation: "This patient has an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is a medical emergency. The preferred treatment for STEMI is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which involves opening the occluded coronary artery with a balloon and placing a stent. However, PCI should be performed within 90 minutes of the first medical contact, which is not possible in this case. Therefore, the next best option is to administer thrombolytic therapy, which dissolves the clot and restores blood flow to the myocardium. Thrombolytic therapy should be given within 12 hours of symptom onset, preferably within 30 minutes of hospital arrival. AHA recommendations for reperfusion management of the STEMI patient who arrives at a non-PCI-capable hospital are as follows. Note that time zero in these recommendations is based on symptom onset time, not time of first medical contact. If presentation is within 2 hours or less of symptom onset, consider immediate fibrinolysis unless transfer time for PCI is anticipated to be no more than 60 minutes (AHA class IIB recommendation). If presentation is within 2 to 3 hours of symptom onset, consider immediate fibrinolysis or PCI if time to transfer for PCI is anticipated to be no more than 60 to 120 minutes (AHA class IIB recommendation). If presentation is within 3 to 12 hours of symptom onset, consider PCI as opposed to initial fibrinolysis if time to transfer for PCI is anticipated to be no more than 120 minutes (AHA class IIB recommendation). - Rosen's Emergency Medicine10th p1031, Tintinalli's 9th p344-346, Harrison's 21st p7584 & chapter 276, UpToDate"

         explanation: "The patient's fever, chills, and right upper quadrant pain, along with the purulent drainage from the T-tube, are indicative of an infection in the biliary system, which is known as cholangitis. Cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract, usually caused by ascending bacteria from the duodenum. It is characterized by the Charcot triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain. It can also present with hypotension and mental confusion (Reynold's pentad). Cholangitis is a serious complication that can lead to sepsis and liver abscess. The most common causes of cholangitis are choledocholithiasis, biliary stricture, and malignancy. In this patient, the T-tube may have acted as a foreign body and predisposed her to cholangitis. Patients with indwelling stents are at particularly high risk for cholangitis, though rarely become jaundiced as a patent stent will prevent the obstruction of bile flow.

Primary ovarian insufficiency refers to a condition where there is a loss of normal ovarian function before the age of 40. It is associated with menopausal symptoms like hot flashes and infertility, not typically with hirsutism or elevated androgen levels. -William's Gynecology 3rd p406-407 (Fig 16-7), Current ObGyn 11th p1621 & p1636, UpToDate"

            'Ectopic pregnancy',
        ],
         explanation: "Preeclampsia is best described as a pregnancy-specific syndrome that can affect virtually every organ system. Although preeclampsia is more than simply gestational hypertension with proteinuria, the appearance of protein remains a primary diagnostic criterion. It is an objective marker and reflects the system-wide endothelial leak that characterizes the preeclampsia syndrome. Last, preeclampsia can be divided into early onset, <34 weeks; late onset, ≥34 weeks; preterm onset, <37 weeks; and term onset, ≥37 weeks. Women with gestational hypertension have blood pressures that reach 140/90 mm Hg or greater for the first time after midpregnancy but lack proteinuria. Gestational hypertension is reclassified by some as transient hypertension if preeclampsia does not develop and blood pressure returns to normal by 12 weeks postpartum. Placenta previa involves the placenta covering the cervix and does not cause hypertension or proteinuria. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and would not progress to 28 weeks of gestation with the described symptoms. - William's Obstetrics 26th p1755, Current ObGyn 11th p856 & p850, MOH ObGyn p199-200"

            'Ovarian cysts',
        ],
         explanation: "Menopause is diagnosed after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. Symptoms include hot flashes, mood swings, and sleep disturbances. According to the ACOG criteria, PMS can be diagnosed if the patient reports at least 1 affective symptom (depression, angry outbursts, irritability, anxiety, confusion, or social withdrawal) and somatic symptom (breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headache, or swelling of extremities) during the 5 days before menses in each of the 3 prior menstrual cycles. These symptoms should be relieved within 4 days of the onset of menses, without recurrence until at least cycle day 13, and should be reproducible during 2 cycles of prospective recording. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus. They can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding and pelvic pain, but they do not cause hot flashes, mood swings, or cessation of menstrual periods. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs in or on an ovary. They are often painless and cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include pelvic pain, bloating, and painful intercourse. Ovarian cysts do not typically cause hot flashes, mood swings, or an absence of periods for an extended time. - Current ObGyn 11th p1724, p1119, William's Gynecology 3rd p333"

         explanation: "Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by an overgrowth of normal vaginal bacteria, not typically associated with severe lower abdominal pain or intracellular gram-negative diplococci. The discharge is usually gray and has a fishy odor. Candidiasis, also known as a yeast infection, candidiasis causes thick, white vaginal discharge that resembles cottage cheese, along with itching and irritation. It does not cause purulent discharge or show gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain. While Chlamydia infection can cause cervical motion tenderness and purulent discharge, it is not typically associated with gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain; Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular bacterium that does not gram stain well. Gonorrhea caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, gonorrhea presents with purulent cervical discharge and can show intracellular gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain.

         explanation: "Nearly all cat, human and most dog bites are left open (to heal by secondary intention). When primary closure is strongly considered because of cosmetic reasons the wound should be: Clinically uninfected, Less than 12 hours old, NOT located on the hand or foot, Lack of underlying injury The wound is located on the forearm, which is not a special site that requires primary closure, such as the face or scalp. The wound is more than 5 mm deep, which is a contraindication for primary closure of puncture wounds, as they may harbor deep infection. The wound is contaminated and potentially infected, which is a contraindication for primary closure of dirty wounds, as they may require debridement and drainage. - STG 4th 2021 p1062, Tintinalli's Emergency Medicine 9th p321, UpToDate"

The rash is characterized by erythema, itchy papules/papulo-vesicles which may become excoriated and lichenified, and typically has a flexural distribution. Patients with AD have higher rates of allergic diseases than the general population. Up to 80% of children with AD develop asthma and/or allergic rhinitis later in childhood. This progression from AD in infancy to allergic rhinitis and asthma in childhood and young adulthood is referred to as the \"allergic march\" or \"atopic march\".

         explanation: "Five-Step Acid-Base Approach to the Basic Metabolic Panel Step 1. Check for Abnormal Values. Patient has low HCO3 concentration (<22 mmol/L) identifies a metabolic acidosis. Step 2. Check the Anion Gap. The anion gap (AG) is calculated with the formula: AG = [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]). For this patient it will be 28 mmol/L The anion gap is used to evaluate for the presence of a wide anion gap metabolic acidosis. A wide anion gap metabolic acidosis is present if the anion gap is elevated (normal = 9-15 mmol/L), regardless of values for HCO3 and pH. So, this patient has Metabolic acidosis with wide/high anion gap. Step 3. If a Metabolic Acidosis is Present, Apply the Rule of 15. Step 4. If a Wide Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis Is Present (Anion Gap ≥15), Check the Delta Gap. Step 5.

        ],
         explanation: "The patient has developed ODS, a rare but serious complication of overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia. ODS is characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system, especially in the pons, due to osmotic stress and cellular edema. The risk of ODS is higher in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver disease. The prevention of ODS is achieved by limiting the correction rate of hyponatremia to <8 mEq/L in 24 hours and <18 mEq/L in 48 hours. Efforts to relower the sodium should commence without waiting for imaging confirmation of demyelinating lesions. The relowering regimen consists of both of the following: D5W, 6 mL/kg lean body weight, infused over two hours. This quantity of D5W should lower the serum sodium by approximately 2 mEq/L, and the infusion should be repeated until the therapeutic goal, which is discussed below, is achieved. Desmopressin, 2 mcg intravenously or subcutaneously every six hours; the dose can be increased to 4 mcg in rare patients who do not respond to lower doses. The desmopressin is continued, even after D5W infusions have ceased, to prevent the serum sodium from rising again due to the excretion of dilute urine. - UpToDate, Harrison's 21st p8361-8362"
